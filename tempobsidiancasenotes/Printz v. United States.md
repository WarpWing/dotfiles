## Basic Information

**Case:** Printz v. United States

**Parties:**  
- **Plaintiff/Appellant:** Jay Printz, Sheriff of Ravalli County, Montana, and Richard Mack, Sheriff of Graham County, Arizona  
- **Defendant/Appellee:** United States of America

**Citation:** 521 U.S. 898 (1997)

**Court:** Supreme Court of the United States

**Year:** 1997

**Judge/Author:** Justice Antonin Scalia authored the majority opinion.

## Laws and Statutes Applied

- **Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (1993):** A federal law requiring background checks on handgun purchasers, temporarily mandating local law enforcement officers to conduct the checks until a federal system was established.
- **10th Amendment:** Reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states or the people, serving as a key constitutional principle in evaluating federal overreach.
- **Necessary and Proper Clause:** Grants Congress authority to pass laws necessary to execute its enumerated powers but does not allow commandeering of state officers to enforce federal laws.

## Facts of the Case

- The Brady Act required local chief law enforcement officers (CLEOs) to conduct background checks on prospective handgun purchasers until the national background check system was fully operational. Jay Printz and Richard Mack, county sheriffs, challenged the constitutionality of this mandate, arguing that the federal government could not compel state officers to execute federal law.
- Printz and Mack contended that the requirement placed an undue burden on state officers and violated the principles of federalism by conscripting state officials into federal service without the consent of the states.
- The government argued that the Brady Act's temporary provisions were a proper exercise of Congress’s authority under the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause, asserting that the federal interest in regulating firearms justified the directive to state officers.

## Procedural History

- The U.S. District Courts ruled in favor of Printz and Mack, holding that the provision was unconstitutional, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, siding with the federal government. The case was then brought before the Supreme Court to resolve the conflict regarding federal commandeering of state officials.

## Question

1. Does the federal government have the authority to compel state and local law enforcement officers to execute federal law, specifically the temporary background check provisions of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act?

## Arguments

### Plaintiff/Appellant

- Printz and Mack argued that the federal government cannot commandeer state officers to enforce federal regulations, as it violates the 10th Amendment and the foundational principles of federalism.
- They contended that the Brady Act's background check requirements imposed administrative and financial burdens on state law enforcement agencies without compensation or congressional approval, infringing on state sovereignty.
- The appellants also argued that the federal government lacked the constitutional authority to direct state officers to carry out federal tasks, which undermined the balance of power between state and federal governments.

### Defendant/Appellee

- The federal government argued that the background check requirements under the Brady Act were necessary to regulate firearms and were a temporary measure until the federal system was established.
- It asserted that the Necessary and Proper Clause provided Congress with the authority to require state officials to perform limited tasks in support of federal objectives, particularly in areas impacting public safety and interstate commerce.
- The government also argued that the minimal demands placed on state officers were reasonable and within Congress’s power to implement national policy efficiently, especially in the interim before federal systems were in place.

## Disposition

- The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Printz, holding that the federal government could not commandeer state and local law enforcement officers to administer or enforce federal regulatory programs, specifically striking down the temporary background check requirements of the Brady Act as unconstitutional.

## Legal Reasoning

- Justice Scalia’s opinion emphasized that the Constitution established a system of dual sovereignty, whereby the federal government and the states share power, but the federal government cannot compel the states to enforce or administer federal regulatory programs.
- The Court held that commandeering state officers to execute federal law violated the 10th Amendment and disrupted the balance of federalism intended by the framers, who deliberately avoided granting Congress such powers to protect state sovereignty.
- The ruling distinguished between cooperative federalism, where states voluntarily participate in federal programs, and commandeering, where states are involuntarily conscripted into service, rejecting the latter as fundamentally incompatible with the Constitution's framework.

## Rule of Law

- The federal government cannot compel state officials to implement or enforce federal law. The anti-commandeering doctrine protects state sovereignty under the 10th Amendment and reinforces the structural integrity of federalism by preventing Congress from transferring the costs and responsibilities of federal regulatory programs to state governments.

## Concurring Opinion(s)

**Author:** Justice Clarence Thomas  
**Key Points:**  
- Thomas agreed with the majority but emphasized that the Necessary and Proper Clause does not extend to requiring states to enforce federal law, arguing for a strict interpretation that maintains clear boundaries between federal and state authority.

## Dissenting Opinion(s)

**Author:** Justice John Paul Stevens  
**Key Points:**  
- Stevens argued that the Brady Act’s temporary requirements were a minor imposition on state officials and did not fundamentally alter the balance of federalism. He contended that Congress has the authority to direct state officials when implementing national policies critical to public safety, such as gun control.

## Key Terms and Definitions

- **Commandeering Doctrine:** The principle that the federal government cannot require states or state officials to enforce federal laws or regulatory programs, reinforcing state sovereignty against federal overreach.
- **Dual Sovereignty:** The concept that federal and state governments operate independently within their respective spheres of authority, with the 10th Amendment safeguarding the states’ reserved powers.

## Questions/Ambiguities

- The decision left open questions about the extent of cooperative federalism and under what circumstances states may be incentivized or coerced into assisting federal enforcement without violating the anti-commandeering doctrine.

## Related Cases

- **New York v. United States (1992):** Established that the federal government cannot compel states to enact or enforce federal regulatory programs, laying the groundwork for the anti-commandeering doctrine solidified in Printz.
- **Murphy v. NCAA (2018):** Reinforced the anti-commandeering principle, ruling that the federal government could not prevent states from legalizing sports betting, reaffirming the limits on federal directives to state legislatures.
- **United States v. Lopez (1995):** Limited Congress’s use of the Commerce Clause to regulate non-economic activities, signaling the Court’s caution against expansive federal powers over local matters.
