## Basic Information

**Case:** New York v. United States

**Parties:**  
- **Plaintiff/Appellant:** State of New York  
- **Defendant/Appellee:** United States of America

**Citation:** 505 U.S. 144 (1992)

**Court:** Supreme Court of the United States

**Year:** 1992

**Judge/Author:** Justice Sandra Day O'Connor authored the majority opinion.

## Laws and Statutes Applied

- **Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985:** A federal law that incentivized states to manage and dispose of low-level radioactive waste generated within their borders.
- **10th Amendment:** Protects state sovereignty by limiting the powers of the federal government, reserving undelegated powers to the states or the people.
- **Commerce Clause:** Grants Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce but is limited when intruding on state sovereignty.

## Facts of the Case

- The Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985 sought to address the issue of radioactive waste disposal by mandating that states either manage their own waste or be held financially accountable.
- The Act included three provisions: financial incentives, access to disposal sites, and a “take-title” provision that required states to take ownership of the waste if they did not comply with federal guidelines.
- New York argued that the “take-title” provision violated the 10th Amendment by coercing states into enacting federal regulations, effectively commandeering state governments to carry out federal policy.

## Procedural History

- The case was brought to the U.S. District Court, which ruled in favor of the United States, upholding the federal law. The decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which reviewed the constitutionality of the Act’s provisions, particularly the “take-title” clause.

## Question

1. Does the federal government have the authority under the Commerce Clause to compel states to take ownership of radioactive waste or enact federal waste disposal regulations, and does this violate the 10th Amendment’s protection of state sovereignty?

## Arguments

### Plaintiff/Appellant

- New York argued that the “take-title” provision violated the 10th Amendment by commandeering state governments, forcing them to either take possession of radioactive waste or regulate according to federal mandates.
- The state contended that this provision constituted an unconstitutional intrusion into state sovereignty, transforming states into administrative arms of the federal government without their consent.
- New York also argued that the federal government’s coercive tactics undermined the principles of federalism by blurring the lines between federal and state responsibilities, imposing undue burdens on state governments.

### Defendant/Appellee

- The United States argued that the provisions of the Act were a legitimate exercise of Congress’s authority under the Commerce Clause, designed to address a critical national problem that required cooperative federal and state efforts.
- The federal government contended that the incentives and the “take-title” provision were reasonable measures to encourage states to fulfill their responsibilities in managing hazardous waste.
- The government further argued that the Act’s structure allowed states significant flexibility in compliance, thus respecting state sovereignty while addressing national health and safety concerns related to waste disposal.

## Disposition

- The Supreme Court ruled in favor of New York, striking down the “take-title” provision as unconstitutional. The Court held that the provision violated the 10th Amendment by coercively commandeering state governments to enforce federal regulatory programs.

## Legal Reasoning

- Justice O'Connor’s opinion emphasized that the Constitution creates a system of dual sovereignty, where state and federal governments operate within distinct spheres of authority. The federal government cannot compel states to enforce federal regulations, as this undermines the balance of power established by the 10th Amendment.
- The Court distinguished between permissible federal incentives and coercive mandates, ruling that the “take-title” provision crossed constitutional boundaries by effectively commandeering state governments to carry out federal directives.
- The decision reinforced the anti-commandeering principle, clarifying that while Congress can encourage states through financial incentives and cooperative agreements, it cannot directly compel states to enact or enforce a federal regulatory scheme.

## Rule of Law

- The federal government cannot compel states to enforce federal regulations through coercive mandates, such as requiring states to take ownership of waste, as it violates the 10th Amendment. The decision reinforces the anti-commandeering doctrine, preserving state sovereignty and maintaining the constitutional balance of power between state and federal governments.

## Concurring Opinion(s)

**Author:** Justice Antonin Scalia  
**Key Points:**  
- Scalia concurred in part, agreeing with the majority’s emphasis on state sovereignty and the unconstitutionality of commandeering state governments, while highlighting the importance of maintaining clear boundaries in the division of state and federal powers.

## Dissenting Opinion(s)

**Author:** Justice White  
**Key Points:**  
- Justice White dissented, arguing that the Act’s provisions were a necessary response to a pressing national issue and represented a legitimate exercise of Congress’s regulatory authority under the Commerce Clause. He contended that cooperative federalism required some degree of state participation in federal regulatory schemes, even if incentivized by mandates.

## Key Terms and Definitions

- **Anti-Commandeering Doctrine:** A constitutional principle that prohibits the federal government from mandating that states or state officials enforce federal law or regulatory programs.
- **Dual Sovereignty:** The concept that the federal and state governments are co-equal entities within their own spheres of authority, each responsible for distinct aspects of governance under the Constitution.

## Questions/Ambiguities

- The decision raises questions about the extent to which Congress can use financial incentives versus direct mandates to achieve federal regulatory goals and the limits of cooperative federalism.

## Related Cases

- **Printz v. United States (1997):** Further solidified the anti-commandeering doctrine, ruling that the federal government could not require state officials to implement federal regulations related to background checks on firearm purchasers.
- **Murphy v. NCAA (2018):** Reinforced the principles established in New York v. United States, holding that the federal government could not prevent states from authorizing sports betting, further delineating the boundaries of federal power over state policy.
- **South Dakota v. Dole (1987):** Upheld the federal government’s use of conditional funding to influence state policy, contrasting permissible incentives with unconstitutional coercion highlighted in New York v. United States.
