## Basic Information

Case: Medellín v. Texas

Parties:  
- **Plaintiff/Appellant:** José Ernesto Medellín  
- **Defendant/Appellee:** State of Texas

Citation: 552 U.S. 491 (2008)

Court: Supreme Court of the United States

Year: 2008

Judge/Author: Chief Justice John Roberts authored the majority opinion.

## Laws and Statutes Applied

- **Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (1963):** An international treaty that requires authorities to notify foreign nationals of their right to contact their consulate when arrested.
- **Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention:** Grants the International Court of Justice (ICJ) jurisdiction to hear disputes arising under the Vienna Convention.
- **U.S. Constitution, Article II:** Provides the President with treaty-making power and outlines the procedures for implementing treaties.
- **Supremacy Clause (Article VI):** Establishes that treaties, along with federal law, are the supreme law of the land, overriding state law where applicable.

## Facts of the Case

- José Ernesto Medellín, a Mexican national, was convicted of rape and murder in Texas and sentenced to death. He was not informed of his right to contact the Mexican consulate under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.
- After Medellín’s conviction, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled in the *Avena* case that the United States had violated the Vienna Convention by failing to inform 51 Mexican nationals, including Medellín, of their consular rights. The ICJ ordered the U.S. to review and reconsider the convictions and sentences.
- President George W. Bush issued a memorandum instructing state courts to comply with the ICJ ruling. However, Texas courts refused to abide by the President’s directive, arguing that neither the ICJ ruling nor the President’s order was binding on state courts.

## Procedural History

- Medellín filed a habeas corpus petition, arguing that the ICJ ruling and the President’s directive entitled him to a reconsideration of his conviction. Texas courts denied his petition, and the case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.

## Question

1. Does a decision of the International Court of Justice, as well as a memorandum issued by the President, require state courts to review and reconsider convictions under the Vienna Convention?

## Arguments

### Plaintiff/Appellant

- Medellín argued that the Vienna Convention, as a ratified treaty, was binding under the Supremacy Clause and that the ICJ’s decision in *Avena* required state courts to review his conviction. He contended that the President’s directive to comply with the ICJ ruling was a valid exercise of executive power in foreign affairs.
- Medellín asserted that Texas’s refusal to abide by the treaty and the President’s order violated international law and the U.S. treaty obligations under the Vienna Convention.

### Defendant/Appellee

- Texas argued that the Vienna Convention was not self-executing, meaning it did not have automatic domestic legal effect without additional legislation from Congress. Therefore, the ICJ’s ruling and the President’s directive were not binding on Texas courts.
- Texas also contended that the President did not have the authority to unilaterally enforce international treaties or ICJ decisions on state courts without Congressional action, as doing so would violate the separation of powers.

## Disposition

- The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Texas, holding that the ICJ decision and the President’s memorandum did not bind state courts. The Court found that the Vienna Convention was not self-executing and thus did not automatically create enforceable rights in U.S. courts.

## Legal Reasoning

- Chief Justice Roberts’ opinion held that while the Vienna Convention is binding on the United States under international law, it is not a self-executing treaty, meaning that it does not automatically have domestic legal force. For the treaty to be enforceable in U.S. courts, Congress would need to pass legislation implementing its provisions.
- The Court also found that the ICJ decision in Avena was not directly enforceable in U.S. courts because the Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention did not create binding obligations on the states without implementing legislation.
- The Court rejected the argument that the President could unilaterally enforce ICJ decisions or treaties against the states. The ruling emphasized that the President’s power to implement treaties is limited by the Constitution, which requires Congressional action to create binding domestic law.

## Rule of Law

- A non-self-executing treaty, like the Vienna Convention, does not automatically create enforceable rights in U.S. courts without implementing legislation from Congress. Additionally, ICJ decisions are not binding on U.S. states unless Congress has passed legislation to enforce them, and the President cannot unilaterally enforce international treaties or ICJ rulings without Congressional authorization.

## Concurring Opinion(s)

No concurring opinions were filed in this case.

## Dissenting Opinion(s)

Author: Justice Stephen Breyer  
Key Points:  
- Justice Breyer dissented, arguing that the United States has an obligation under international law to comply with the ICJ ruling, and that the Vienna Convention should be interpreted as self-executing. He contended that the President’s directive to comply with the ICJ’s decision was a valid exercise of executive power, and that Texas should have been required to reconsider Medellin’s conviction.

## Key Terms and Definitions

- **Self-Executing Treaty:** A treaty that automatically becomes enforceable as domestic law upon ratification, without the need for additional legislation.
- **Non-Self-Executing Treaty:** A treaty that requires implementing legislation from Congress to be enforceable in domestic courts.
- **Supremacy Clause:** The constitutional provision that federal law and treaties are the supreme law of the land, taking precedence over conflicting state laws.
- **Executive Power:** The authority vested in the President to conduct foreign affairs, including the power to negotiate and enforce treaties, though the President’s power is subject to constitutional limitations.

## Questions/Ambiguities

- The ruling leaves open questions about the extent to which international treaties and ICJ decisions can be enforced in domestic courts without Congressional legislation, and the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches in implementing treaty obligations.
