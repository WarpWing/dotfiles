## Basic Information

**Case:** Gonzales v. Raich

**Parties:** Alberto Gonzales, Attorney General (Plaintiff) v. Angel Raich and Diane Monson (Defendants)

**Citation:** [545 U.S. 1 (2005)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/545/1/)

**Court:** United States Supreme Court

**Year:** 2005

**Judge/Author:** Justice John Paul Stevens

---

## Laws and Statutes Applied

- **Commerce Clause** (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the U.S. Constitution)
- **Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (CSA)** (21 U.S.C. § 801 et seq.)
- **California’s Compassionate Use Act of 1996**

---

## Facts of the Case

- Angel Raich and Diane Monson were California residents using marijuana for medical purposes under California's Compassionate Use Act, which allowed the use of medical marijuana in the state.
- Federal agents, acting under the authority of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), seized and destroyed marijuana plants from Monson's home, despite her compliance with California law.
- Raich and Monson challenged the federal government's power to enforce the CSA against medical marijuana use that was non-commercial and intrastate (entirely within California's borders).
- The plaintiffs argued that this enforcement exceeded Congress's power under the Commerce Clause.

---

## Procedural History

- The District Court ruled against Raich and Monson, upholding the federal enforcement of the CSA.
- The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision, ruling that the CSA’s application to non-commercial, intrastate use of medical marijuana exceeded Congress's Commerce Clause power.
- The United States appealed to the Supreme Court.

## Question

1. **Does Congress have the authority under the Commerce Clause to prohibit the local cultivation and use of marijuana, in compliance with state law, for medical purposes?**

---

## Arguments

### Plaintiff/Appellant (Gonzales, United States)

- **Broad Commerce Clause Power:** Argued that under the Commerce Clause, Congress has the authority to regulate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce, even if those activities are non-commercial and intrastate in nature.
- **CSA’s Purpose:** Asserted that the Controlled Substances Act is a comprehensive regulatory scheme designed to control drug abuse and trafficking, and local cultivation of marijuana could undermine these federal goals by affecting supply and demand in the national drug market.

### Defendant/Appellee (Raich and Monson)

- **Local and Non-Commercial:** Argued that their cultivation and use of marijuana were purely local, non-commercial activities, and thus did not substantially affect interstate commerce.
- **State Sovereignty:** Contended that California's Compassionate Use Act was a valid exercise of the state’s police power, and federal intervention infringed upon state sovereignty.
- **Medical Necessity:** Argued that medical marijuana was essential for Raich’s health, making federal enforcement of the CSA in this context unjustified.

---

## Disposition

- **6-3 Decision:** The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Gonzales, upholding the application of the Controlled Substances Act to intrastate, non-commercial cultivation and use of marijuana.

---

## Legal Reasoning

- **Wickard v. Filburn Precedent:** The Court applied the precedent from *Wickard v. Filburn* (1942), which held that even local, non-commercial activities could be regulated if, in the aggregate, they had a substantial effect on interstate commerce. The Court reasoned that Raich's and Monson’s marijuana cultivation could have a cumulative effect on the national market for illegal drugs.
- **Comprehensive Regulatory Scheme:** The Court emphasized that the CSA was part of a broad regulatory framework to control drug distribution. Allowing local exceptions, even for medical purposes, could weaken federal drug policy and create loopholes for drug trafficking.
- **Rational Basis Test:** The Court found that Congress had a rational basis for concluding that local cultivation and use of marijuana, even for medical purposes, could affect the interstate market for marijuana.

---

## Rule of Law

- **Congress may regulate local, non-commercial activities under the Commerce Clause if, in the aggregate, those activities have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.**
- **The Controlled Substances Act’s prohibition on marijuana cultivation and use applies even to intrastate medical use in compliance with state law.**

---

## Concurring Opinion(s)

**Author:** Justice Antonin Scalia

**Key Points:**

- Justice Scalia emphasized the broad authority of Congress under the Necessary and Proper Clause to regulate activities that interfere with a federal regulatory scheme. He agreed with the majority that the federal government’s interest in regulating the interstate drug market justified its actions, even if the regulated activity was intrastate and non-commercial.

---

## Dissenting Opinion(s)

**Author:** Justice Sandra Day O'Connor (joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Clarence Thomas)

**Key Points:**

- **Federalism Concerns:** Justice O’Connor argued that the decision undermined state sovereignty and the ability of states to serve as "laboratories of democracy." California’s law represented an effort to address medical issues through state-specific solutions, and federal overreach in this area contradicted principles of federalism.
- **Commerce Clause Limits:** She contended that the local cultivation and use of marijuana, in compliance with state law and for personal, medical purposes, did not have a substantial effect on interstate commerce and thus should not be subject to federal regulation.
- **Tenth Amendment:** Justice Thomas argued that the majority’s decision expanded federal power too far, threatening the autonomy of the states and ignoring the constitutional limits on Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause.

## Key Terms and Definitions

- **Commerce Clause:** The constitutional provision granting Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states.
- **Controlled Substances Act (CSA):** A federal law that regulates the manufacture, possession, and distribution of drugs, including marijuana.
- **Compassionate Use Act (California):** A state law legalizing the use of medical marijuana under specific conditions, conflicting with federal law under the CSA.
- **Wickard v. Filburn:** A key Supreme Court precedent holding that even local, non-commercial activities can be regulated under the Commerce Clause if they have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.

## Questions/Ambiguities

- **Federalism and States’ Rights:** How should the balance between state sovereignty and federal regulatory power be maintained, especially in cases where state laws conflict with federal statutes?
- **Commerce Clause Limits:** Where should the line be drawn in defining the scope of Congress’s Commerce Clause powers in regulating purely local, non-commercial activities?
- **Medical Use of Controlled Substances:** Should there be an exception for medical necessity in cases involving federal drug regulation, particularly when state laws permit medical use?
