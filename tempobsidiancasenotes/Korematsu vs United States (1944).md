## Basic Information

Case: Korematsu v. United States

Parties:  
- **Plaintiff/Appellant:** Fred Korematsu  
- **Defendant/Appellee:** United States of America

Citation: 323 U.S. 214 (1944)

Court: Supreme Court of the United States

Year: 1944

Judge/Author: Justice Hugo Black authored the majority opinion.

## Laws and Statutes Applied

- **Executive Order 9066 (1942):** Authorized the Secretary of War to prescribe military areas from which any or all persons could be excluded, resulting in the forced relocation and internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.
- **Article II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution:** Grants the President powers as Commander in Chief of the military, under which the executive order was issued.
- **Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment:** Prohibits states from denying any person within their jurisdiction equal protection of the laws, although the case considered these principles under the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, which is applied to federal actions.

## Facts of the Case

- Following Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, which led to the forced relocation and internment of approximately 120,000 Japanese Americans, most of whom were U.S. citizens. The government argued that this action was necessary for national security reasons, fearing espionage and sabotage.
- Fred Korematsu, an American citizen of Japanese descent, refused to comply with the order to relocate to an internment camp and was subsequently arrested and convicted of violating the military’s exclusion orders.
- Korematsu challenged the constitutionality of his conviction and the internment policy, arguing that the government’s actions violated his civil rights under the Equal Protection Clause and amounted to racial discrimination.

## Procedural History

- Korematsu’s conviction was upheld by the U.S. District Court and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Korematsu then appealed to the Supreme Court, challenging the internment orders as unconstitutional.

## Question

1. Did the President and Congress exceed their war powers by implementing the internment of Japanese Americans through Executive Order 9066, thus violating the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause?

## Arguments

### Plaintiff/Appellant

- Korematsu argued that the exclusion order and internment policy were based solely on race and national origin, and that the government had violated his constitutional rights by subjecting him to discriminatory treatment without any evidence of disloyalty or wrongdoing.
- He contended that the internment of Japanese Americans was a gross overreach of wartime powers and that the government’s justification of "military necessity" was insufficient to override the basic protections of individual liberty and equality.

### Defendant/Appellee

- The U.S. government defended the exclusion orders as a necessary wartime measure, citing concerns about espionage and sabotage by individuals of Japanese descent on the West Coast.
- The government argued that, in times of extreme national emergency, the military must have broad discretion to act in the interests of national security, even if such actions impact the civil rights of citizens. The government claimed that the racial classification was not discriminatory but rather a strategic response to perceived threats.

## Disposition

- The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the United States, upholding Korematsu’s conviction and the internment orders. The Court found that the exclusion orders were justified during a time of "emergency and peril" and did not violate the Constitution.

## Legal Reasoning

- Justice Black’s majority opinion acknowledged that racial classifications are inherently suspect and subject to "the most rigid scrutiny." However, the Court concluded that the government's actions were justified by military necessity during wartime and that the exclusion orders were not based on racial prejudice but rather on strategic considerations related to national security.
- The Court held that the judiciary must defer to the executive and military’s judgment in matters of national defense, especially in times of war. The opinion emphasized that while the exclusion orders involved racial discrimination, the urgent circumstances justified the government's actions to prevent espionage and sabotage.

## Rule of Law

- The federal government may exercise extraordinary powers during wartime, including the suspension of certain civil liberties, when it is deemed necessary to protect national security. However, such actions must still undergo strict scrutiny when racial classifications are involved, though they may be upheld if the government can demonstrate a compelling need.

## Concurring Opinion(s)

Author: Justice Felix Frankfurter  
Key Points:  
- Justice Frankfurter concurred, emphasizing that the constitutionality of the internment order must be viewed within the context of the President's war powers. He argued that the decision was a valid exercise of the executive branch’s authority under the Constitution during wartime.

## Dissenting Opinion(s)

Author: Justice Robert Jackson  
Key Points:  
- Justice Jackson dissented, arguing that the exclusion order amounted to racial discrimination, which could not be justified by wartime considerations. He warned that the decision set a dangerous precedent by allowing racial classifications under the guise of military necessity, which could erode constitutional protections in times of crisis.
- Jackson further stated that the Court's endorsement of the internment order placed the judiciary in the role of legitimizing unconstitutional executive actions.

## Key Terms and Definitions

- **Military Necessity:** A legal concept allowing for extraordinary measures to be taken during wartime to ensure national security, even if such actions infringe upon individual rights.
- **Strict Scrutiny:** The highest level of judicial review applied to cases involving racial classifications or fundamental rights, requiring the government to prove a compelling interest and that the law is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.

## Questions/Ambiguities

- The ruling leaves open questions about the balance between civil liberties and national security, particularly during times of war or emergency. The case also raises broader questions about the lasting implications of the decision on the treatment of racial minorities in future national security cases.

## Subsequent Developments

- Korematsu has been widely criticized in subsequent years and is considered a dark moment in American legal history. In [[Trump v. Hawaii (2018)]], Chief Justice John Roberts stated that the Korematsu decision had been "gravely wrong the day it was decided," effectively discrediting the ruling, though the Court did not formally overturn it.
