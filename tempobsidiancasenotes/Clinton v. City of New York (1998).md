## Basic Information

Case: Clinton v. City of New York

Parties:  
- **Plaintiff/Appellant:** City of New York, et al.  
- **Defendant/Appellee:** William J. Clinton, President of the United States

Citation: 524 U.S. 417 (1998)

Court: Supreme Court of the United States

Year: 1998

Judge/Author: Justice John Paul Stevens authored the majority opinion.

## Laws and Statutes Applied

- **Line Item Veto Act of 1996:** Granted the President the power to cancel specific provisions of bills, particularly spending and tax benefit measures, after signing them into law, subject to congressional override.
- **Article I, Section 7 of the U.S. Constitution:** Outlines the legislative process, including the requirements for the passage of bills by both houses of Congress and presentment to the President for approval or veto.
- **Presentment Clause:** Requires that all bills approved by Congress be presented to the President in their entirety for approval or rejection, without alterations.

## Facts of the Case

- The Line Item Veto Act allowed the President to cancel specific spending provisions in bills passed by Congress, aiming to reduce unnecessary expenditures and target wasteful spending.
- President Clinton used the line-item veto to cancel a provision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 that granted federal funds to New York City hospitals, as well as a tax break for food processors in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.
- The City of New York and other affected parties filed suit, arguing that the cancellations altered the legislative intent and exceeded the President’s constitutional authority, violating the separation of powers by allowing the President to unilaterally amend laws passed by Congress.

## Procedural History

- The District Court ruled in favor of the City of New York, declaring the Line Item Veto Act unconstitutional as it allowed the President to unilaterally change laws without following the proper legislative process. The decision was appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

## Question

1. Does the Line Item Veto Act, which allows the President to cancel specific provisions of duly enacted federal laws, violate the Presentment Clause and the separation of powers principles outlined in Article I of the Constitution?

## Arguments

### Plaintiff/Appellant

- The City of New York argued that the Line Item Veto Act violated the Presentment Clause by enabling the President to unilaterally amend or repeal portions of laws without returning the entire bill to Congress for reconsideration, bypassing the constitutionally mandated process.
- The plaintiffs contended that the Act effectively granted the President legislative powers, undermining the separation of powers by allowing the executive to alter laws after they were passed, disrupting the careful balance between the branches.
- They argued that the cancellations directly harmed the City’s financial interests and disrupted congressional intent, showing a clear overreach of executive authority that was inconsistent with the Constitution’s allocation of lawmaking powers.

### Defendant/Appellee

- The government argued that the Line Item Veto Act was a necessary tool for the President to control federal spending and eliminate unnecessary or wasteful expenditures without vetoing entire bills, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the federal budget process.
- The defense maintained that the Act did not violate the Presentment Clause because it was enacted through the normal legislative process, giving the President discretionary authority to cancel specific provisions in the interest of fiscal responsibility.
- The government contended that the line-item veto was a form of delegated authority from Congress, which could be modified or revoked, arguing that it did not alter the fundamental structure of the legislative process.

## Disposition

- The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the City of New York, striking down the Line Item Veto Act as unconstitutional. The Court held that the Act violated the Presentment Clause and the separation of powers by allowing the President to unilaterally amend or repeal parts of statutes without following the constitutionally prescribed legislative process.

## Legal Reasoning

- Justice Stevens’ opinion emphasized that the Presentment Clause explicitly requires that every bill passed by Congress must be presented to the President in its entirety for approval or veto, without the possibility of selective cancellation of parts of the law.
- The Court held that the Line Item Veto Act effectively granted the President the power to change laws after their enactment, bypassing the legislative procedures that safeguard the separation of powers and prevent executive encroachment on Congress’s authority.
- The decision reaffirmed that the Constitution does not permit the President to unilaterally alter or amend legislation, stressing that any changes to the established legislative process must be accomplished through constitutional amendment, not statutory innovation.

## Rule of Law

- The Line Item Veto Act violates the Presentment Clause and the separation of powers by allowing the President to unilaterally amend or repeal parts of duly enacted federal laws. The Constitution requires that all legislative actions altering rights or duties must adhere to the procedures of bicameralism and presentment, ensuring that the balance between the legislative and executive branches is maintained.

## Concurring Opinion(s)

Author: Justice Anthony Kennedy  
Key Points:  
- Justice Kennedy’s concurrence highlighted the broader implications for the separation of powers, warning that the line-item veto represented an encroachment on legislative authority that could undermine the constitutional balance between the branches. He emphasized that the framers designed the legislative process to prevent arbitrary power and preserve democratic accountability.

## Dissenting Opinion(s)

Author: Justice Stephen Breyer  
Key Points:  
- Justice Breyer dissented, arguing that the line-item veto was a pragmatic tool designed to improve fiscal management and that Congress had the authority to grant such discretionary power to the President. He contended that the Act did not fundamentally alter the separation of powers and that the practical benefits of reducing wasteful spending justified its use.

## Key Terms and Definitions

- **Line Item Veto:** The power to veto specific provisions or items within a bill without rejecting the entire piece of legislation, allowing selective cancellation by the executive.
- **Presentment Clause:** A constitutional requirement mandating that every bill passed by Congress be presented to the President for approval or veto in its entirety, ensuring executive participation in the legislative process as designed by the framers.
- **Separation of Powers:** A fundamental principle of the U.S. Constitution dividing government powers among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches to prevent the concentration of authority and provide checks and balances.
  
## Questions/Ambiguities

- The ruling raises questions about how Congress can achieve fiscal discipline without resorting to measures that violate constitutional constraints, and whether alternative mechanisms could provide effective oversight of federal spending without infringing on the separation of powers.
