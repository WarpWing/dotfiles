## Basic Information

Case: Ex parte Milligan

Parties:  
- **Plaintiff/Appellant:** Lambdin P. Milligan  
- **Defendant/Appellee:** United States of America

Citation: 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 2 (1866)

Court: Supreme Court of the United States

Year: 1866

Judge/Author: Justice David Davis authored the majority opinion.

## Laws and Statutes Applied

- **Habeas Corpus Suspension Act (1863):** Allowed the President to suspend the writ of habeas corpus during the Civil War, giving military authorities the power to detain individuals without trial in areas of rebellion.
- **Article III of the U.S. Constitution:** Establishes the right to trial by jury in federal courts.
- **Fifth and Sixth Amendments:** Guarantee the rights to due process, a speedy trial, and a trial by jury in criminal cases.

## Facts of the Case

- Lambdin P. Milligan (Known Copperhead), a civilian resident of Indiana, was arrested by the U.S. military in 1864 during the Civil War. He was accused of conspiring to overthrow the Union government, aiding the Confederacy, and planning to free Confederate prisoners of war. Milligan was tried by a military commission, found guilty, and sentenced to death.
- Milligan challenged his conviction, arguing that the military tribunal had no jurisdiction to try him because civilian courts were open and operational in Indiana, and he had not been involved in active military service or rebellion.
- Milligan filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that his constitutional rights had been violated because he was a civilian subject to civilian courts, not military jurisdiction.

## Procedural History

- Milligan’s petition for habeas corpus was denied by the lower courts, and he appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that his trial by a military commission was unconstitutional given that civilian courts were functioning at the time of his arrest and trial.

## Question

1. Did the military tribunal have the authority to try and sentence a civilian in a state where civilian courts were open and operational, thus suspending the right to a jury trial and habeas corpus during the Civil War?

## Arguments

### Plaintiff/Appellant

- Milligan argued that as a civilian residing in a state where the courts were open and operational, he was entitled to the protections of the Constitution, including the right to a trial by jury in a civilian court.
- He contended that the military commission lacked jurisdiction over him, as the suspension of habeas corpus and use of military tribunals were only valid in areas where civilian authority had collapsed or where martial law had been declared.
- Milligan claimed that the government’s actions in trying him before a military commission violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to due process and a jury trial.

### Defendant/Appellee

- The U.S. government argued that during the Civil War, President Lincoln had suspended habeas corpus and authorized military tribunals to try individuals suspected of treason or aiding the Confederacy.
- The government maintained that in times of national crisis, particularly during war, the executive branch had the authority to act swiftly and decisively to ensure national security, even if that meant bypassing certain constitutional protections.
- The government argued that the military commission had jurisdiction over Milligan because he was accused of engaging in actions that threatened the Union’s war effort, which justified the use of military justice.

## Disposition

- The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Milligan, holding that the military commission lacked the authority to try civilians when civilian courts were open and operational (Active hostility + courts are closed). The Court found that the use of military tribunals in Milligan’s case violated his constitutional rights.

## Legal Reasoning

- Justice Davis’s majority opinion emphasized that the Constitution does not permit the suspension of civil liberties, including the right to a fair trial, in areas where civilian courts are functioning, even during times of war. The Court ruled that martial law could only be applied in areas where civilian courts were closed, and civilian authority had broken down.
- The Court held that Milligan’s trial by a military tribunal was unconstitutional because he was a civilian residing in a state that was not in active rebellion and where the courts were still operational. The Court stressed that the government could not substitute military justice for civilian justice in such circumstances.
- The ruling reaffirmed the importance of constitutional protections, including the right to habeas corpus and trial by jury, even during times of national crisis. The Court rejected the argument that wartime necessity could justify the indefinite suspension of civil liberties.

## Rule of Law

- The Constitution does not permit the trial of civilians by military tribunals when civilian courts are open and functioning, even during times of war. Martial law and the suspension of habeas corpus can only be applied in areas where civilian authority has collapsed and civil courts are unavailable.

## Concurring Opinion(s)

No concurring opinions were filed, as the decision was unanimous.

## Dissenting Opinion(s)

No dissenting opinions were filed, as the decision was unanimous.

## Key Terms and Definitions

- **Habeas Corpus:** A legal writ that requires a person under arrest to be brought before a judge to determine whether their detention is lawful. The suspension of habeas corpus allows the government to detain individuals without judicial oversight in certain emergency situations.
- **Martial Law:** The imposition of military control over civilian populations, typically in times of emergency, when civilian government and the rule of law have collapsed.
- **Military Tribunal:** A military court used to try individuals for offenses against military law or during times of war, often used when civilian courts are unavailable.

## Questions/Ambiguities

- The decision raises questions about the balance between civil liberties and national security during times of war, particularly how far the government can go in suspending constitutional rights in the name of national defense.
