## Basic Information

Case: INS v. Chadha

Parties:  
- **Plaintiff/Appellant:** Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)  
- **Defendant/Appellee:** Jagdish Rai Chadha

Citation: 462 U.S. 919 (1983)

Court: Supreme Court of the United States

Year: 1983

Judge/Author: Chief Justice Warren E. Burger authored the majority opinion.

## Laws and Statutes Applied

- **Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) of 1952:** This statute included a provision allowing either house of Congress to invalidate decisions of the Attorney General to suspend deportations of specific individuals through a legislative veto.
- **Article I, Section 7 of the U.S. Constitution:** Establishes the legislative process, including bicameralism (passage of laws by both houses) and presentment (requiring bills to be presented to the President for approval).
- **Separation of Powers Doctrine:** A constitutional principle dividing the powers of government among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches to prevent the concentration of authority and ensure checks and balances.

## Facts of the Case

- Jagdish Rai Chadha, an East Indian born in Kenya, overstayed his student visa in the United States. He faced deportation under the Immigration and Nationality Act but successfully petitioned the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to suspend his deportation due to his established ties in the U.S. and potential hardships if deported.
- The INS agreed to suspend Chadha’s deportation, but the House of Representatives exercised a one-house legislative veto, overturning the suspension without debate or a vote by the Senate, thereby ordering Chadha’s deportation.
- Chadha challenged the constitutionality of the legislative veto, arguing that it violated the principles of bicameralism and presentment outlined in the Constitution. The INS, though technically the appellant, agreed that the legislative veto was unconstitutional, aligning with Chadha’s position.

## Procedural History

- The Board of Immigration Appeals upheld the House’s legislative veto and ordered Chadha’s deportation. Chadha then appealed the decision, and the case was ultimately brought before the Supreme Court to determine the constitutionality of the legislative veto mechanism under the INA.

## Question

1. Does the legislative veto provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows one house of Congress to overturn executive decisions, violate the constitutional principles of bicameralism and presentment as required by Article I, Section 7 of the U.S. Constitution?

## Arguments

### Plaintiff/Appellant

- The INS argued, in agreement with Chadha, that the legislative veto violated the Constitution’s requirements for enacting legislation, specifically the principles of bicameralism and presentment, which are essential to maintaining the separation of powers.
- The INS contended that allowing one house of Congress to unilaterally veto executive actions without presenting the measure to the other house or the President fundamentally undermined the legislative process set forth in the Constitution.
- The legislative veto was characterized as an unconstitutional encroachment on executive authority, permitting Congress to act outside its defined legislative role and disrupting the balance of power between branches.

### Defendant/Appellee

- The House of Representatives argued that the legislative veto was a practical and necessary tool for congressional oversight of executive actions, especially in areas involving broad delegations of power such as immigration.
- It contended that the legislative veto provided a check on the executive’s discretion, allowing Congress to maintain some control over delegated powers without the lengthy and cumbersome process of passing new legislation.
- The legislative veto was defended as an efficient mechanism to oversee the executive branch and ensure accountability, arguing that it served an essential function in managing the increasing complexities of modern governance.

## Disposition

- The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Chadha, declaring the legislative veto provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act unconstitutional. The Court found that the legislative veto violated the explicit constitutional requirements of bicameralism and presentment.

## Legal Reasoning

- Chief Justice Burger’s opinion emphasized that the Constitution’s framers deliberately crafted a legislative process that required both houses of Congress to pass legislation and present it to the President for approval or veto. This process was designed to protect against the arbitrary exercise of power and ensure thorough deliberation.
- The Court found that the legislative veto circumvented these essential safeguards by allowing a single house to take unilateral action without the involvement of the other house or the President, violating the separation of powers.
- The decision underscored that even when practical or convenient, Congress cannot alter the constitutional framework of lawmaking. Any action that effectively alters rights, duties, or obligations must adhere to the Constitution’s explicit procedures, preserving the balance among the branches of government.

## Rule of Law

- Legislative vetoes, which allow one house of Congress to unilaterally overturn executive actions without following the constitutional requirements of bicameralism and presentment, violate the separation of powers and the lawmaking process outlined in Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution. All legislative actions altering legal rights or duties must follow the prescribed procedures, ensuring checks and balances.

## Concurring Opinion(s)

Author: Justice Lewis Powell  
Key Points:  
- Justice Powell concurred, focusing on the threat posed by legislative vetoes to the separation of powers, noting that the veto mechanism amounted to Congress unconstitutionally assuming judicial or executive functions. He warned against the dangers of legislative overreach into areas reserved for the other branches.

## Dissenting Opinion(s)

Author: Justice Byron White  
Key Points:  
- Justice White dissented, arguing that the legislative veto was a necessary adaptation to the complexities of modern governance and that the Constitution’s silence on the veto did not necessarily prohibit it. He viewed the legislative veto as a practical check on executive authority that should be judged by its effectiveness rather than strict adherence to formal constitutional requirements.

## Key Terms and Definitions

- **Bicameralism:** The principle requiring that all legislative measures be approved by both the House of Representatives and the Senate before becoming law.
- **Presentment Clause:** A constitutional requirement that all bills passed by Congress be presented to the President for approval or veto, ensuring executive participation in the legislative process.
- **Legislative Veto:** A mechanism allowing one or both houses of Congress to overturn or nullify actions taken by the executive branch without passing a new law or obtaining presidential approval.

## Questions/Ambiguities

- The ruling left open questions about how Congress can effectively oversee executive actions without legislative vetoes, prompting a reassessment of congressional oversight tools and their compatibility with constitutional requirements.
