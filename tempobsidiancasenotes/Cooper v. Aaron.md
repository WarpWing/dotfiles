## Basic Information

Case: Cooper v. Aaron (1958)  
Parties: William G. Cooper (Plaintiff) vs. John Aaron (Defendant)  
Citation: [358 US 1 (1958)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/358/1/)  
Court: Warren Court  
Year: 1958  
Judge/Author: Earl Warren  

## Laws and Statues Applied

- Equal Protection Clause  
- Supremacy Clause (Article VI)  
- 14th Amendment (Proximate to the interpretation in Brown v. Board of Education)  

## Facts of the Case

- The State of Arkansas openly resisted the Supreme Court's ruling in Brown v. Board of Education. On February 20, 1958 (five months after the integration crisis involving the Little Rock Nine), members of the School Board (along with the Superintendent of Schools) filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas.
- This suit requested the suspension of the desegregation plan. Specifically, the plaintiffs sought relief by requesting that Black children be returned to segregated schools and the desegregation plan be postponed for 2.5 years.
- The context of this case followed public defiance by Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus, who had ordered the Arkansas National Guard to block the Little Rock Nine from entering Central High School.

## Procedural History

- Following the initial suit filed after the Little Rock Nine incident, the district court granted the school board's request to suspend desegregation.
- The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit reversed the district court’s decision, ruling against the suspension and affirming the desegregation order.

## Question

- Were Arkansas officials bound by federal court orders mandating desegregation?

## Arguments

### Plaintiff/Appellant (William G. Cooper)

- The chaotic and violent resistance to desegregation in Little Rock justified a delay in enforcing Brown v. Board of Education.  
- The plaintiffs argued that the social unrest and threats of violence compromised the safety of both students and the community, and the situation required a temporary suspension of the desegregation order.  
- They claimed that maintaining public order was paramount, and postponing integration would allow for a calmer implementation of the Supreme Court's mandate.

### Defendant/Appellee (John Aaron)

- The defendants, representing the Black students seeking integration, argued that any delay in enforcing Brown v. Board of Education was a violation of their constitutional rights under the 14th Amendment.  
- They emphasized that federal court orders must be followed under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, and no state authority could override or resist them.  
- They further argued that public order concerns were insufficient to delay desegregation, as racial discrimination in schools was unconstitutional and had to be rectified immediately.

## Disposition / Conclusion

- The Supreme Court unanimously affirmed the 8th Circuit’s decision, ruling that the state of Arkansas was bound by the federal court's desegregation order. Arkansas officials could not resist or ignore federal mandates under the Supremacy Clause.

## Legal Reasoning

- The Court held that state officials are bound by the decisions of the Supreme Court under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The states are not entitled to nullify federal laws or court decisions based on their own preferences or interpretations.  
- The Court reaffirmed that Brown v. Board of Education was the law of the land and that the integration of public schools could not be delayed or obstructed by state action.  
- The Court also rejected arguments that public unrest or the need for order could justify a delay in desegregation, emphasizing that constitutional rights cannot be compromised for political or social expediency.

## Rule of Law

- The Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution binds state officials to federal court rulings, and any resistance to federal law or Supreme Court decisions is unconstitutional. The 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause guarantees the right to desegregated education.
