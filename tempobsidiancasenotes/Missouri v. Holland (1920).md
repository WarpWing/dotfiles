## Basic Information

Case: Missouri v. Holland

Parties:  
- **Plaintiff/Appellant:** State of Missouri  
- **Defendant/Appellee:** Ray P. Holland, U.S. Game Warden

Citation: 252 U.S. 416 (1920)

Court: Supreme Court of the United States

Year: 1920

Judge/Author: Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes authored the majority opinion.

## Laws and Statutes Applied

- **Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918:** Enacted to enforce a treaty between the United States and Great Britain (on behalf of Canada) to protect migratory bird species that crossed international borders. The law imposed restrictions on hunting certain bird species.
- **Article VI, Clause 2 (Supremacy Clause) of the U.S. Constitution:** Establishes that treaties and federal laws made under the Constitution are the supreme law of the land, overriding conflicting state laws.
- **10th Amendment:** Reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states or the people, central to Missouri’s argument about state sovereignty.

## Facts of the Case

- The United States entered into a treaty with Great Britain in 1916 to protect migratory birds that traverse international borders. Congress passed the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 to implement the treaty, making it unlawful to kill, capture, or sell certain bird species.
- Missouri challenged the act, arguing that regulating bird hunting was a matter reserved for the states under the 10th Amendment. The state contended that the federal government overstepped its constitutional authority by using the treaty power to regulate an issue traditionally within state control.
- Ray Holland, a U.S. Game Warden, was enforcing the Act in Missouri, prompting the state to file a lawsuit seeking to prevent federal agents from enforcing the law within its borders.

## Procedural History

- Missouri brought the case in federal court, arguing that the Migratory Bird Treaty Act infringed on state sovereignty. The District Court dismissed Missouri’s case, and the state appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

## Question

1. Does the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, enacted to fulfill the terms of an international treaty, violate the 10th Amendment by infringing upon powers reserved to the states?

## Arguments

### Plaintiff/Appellant

- Missouri argued that the regulation of wildlife, including migratory birds, fell within the powers reserved to the states under the 10th Amendment. The state maintained that hunting and wildlife management were matters of local concern and should be governed by state law, not federal regulation.
- Missouri contended that the federal government could not expand its regulatory authority simply by entering into a treaty with another country. It argued that allowing the federal government to regulate areas traditionally under state control through the treaty power would undermine state sovereignty and federalism.

### Defendant/Appellee

- The federal government argued that the Supremacy Clause made treaties, along with federal laws enacted to implement them, the supreme law of the land, overriding any conflicting state laws.
- The government contended that the treaty power, granted to the federal government in Article II of the Constitution, allowed Congress to pass laws necessary to fulfill treaty obligations. Since the protection of migratory birds was an international concern, the federal government was within its rights to regulate the issue through the treaty.
- The defense emphasized the international nature of migratory birds, arguing that effective regulation could not be achieved at the state level alone and required national and international coordination.

## Disposition

- The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the United States, upholding the constitutionality of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The Court found that the treaty and the law enacted to implement it were valid exercises of federal power.

## Legal Reasoning

- Justice Holmes’ opinion emphasized that the treaty power granted to the federal government in the Constitution was not limited by the 10th Amendment. The Court held that treaties made by the federal government, along with laws enacted to implement those treaties, were supreme over state laws, as provided by the Supremacy Clause.
- Holmes stated that the national interest in protecting migratory birds transcended state boundaries, making the issue a legitimate subject for international agreements and federal regulation. The opinion recognized that states retained power in many areas, but when a treaty addressed a national or international concern, the federal government had the authority to act.
- The ruling reinforced the idea that the treaty power could be used to regulate areas that might otherwise be beyond the reach of Congress’s legislative authority, as long as the treaty itself was valid.

## Rule of Law

- The federal government’s treaty power, combined with the Supremacy Clause, allows Congress to enact legislation necessary to implement treaties, even in areas traditionally regulated by the states. Treaties, and the laws made to enforce them, are supreme over conflicting state laws.

## Concurring Opinion(s)

No concurring opinions were filed, as the decision was unanimous.

## Dissenting Opinion(s)

No dissenting opinions were filed, as the decision was unanimous.

## Key Terms and Definitions

- **Supremacy Clause:** A constitutional provision establishing that federal laws and treaties are the supreme law of the land, overriding state laws when conflicts arise.
- **Treaty Power:** The authority of the federal government to enter into agreements with other nations, as provided by Article II of the Constitution. This power allows Congress to pass legislation necessary to fulfill treaty obligations.
- **10th Amendment:** Part of the Bill of Rights, this amendment reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states or the people, central to debates about federalism and state sovereignty.

## Questions/Ambiguities

- The decision raises questions about the limits of the treaty power, particularly whether there are any areas traditionally reserved for states that treaties cannot reach. It also leaves open the extent to which Congress can legislate under the treaty power in other areas not explicitly covered by the Constitution.
