**Court:** United States Supreme Court

**Year:** 1964

**Judge/Author:** Justice Tom C. Clark

---

## Laws Applied

- **Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title II**

---

## Facts of the Case

- Ollie's Barbecue, a restaurant in Birmingham, Alabama, refused to serve African American customers in its dining area, violating Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
- The restaurant argued that because it did not engage in interstate commerce (only a small portion of its food came from out of state), it was not subject to federal regulation under the Commerce Clause.

---

## Procedural History

- The lower courts ruled in favor of McClung, finding that the restaurant’s local nature exempted it from the Civil Rights Act.
- The United States appealed to the Supreme Court.

---

## Question(s)

1. **Does Congress have the authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate a local business, like a restaurant, that does not directly engage in interstate commerce but receives some supplies from interstate commerce?**

---

## Arguments

### Plaintiff/Appellant (Katzenbach)

- **Interstate Commerce Impact:** Argued that racial discrimination in restaurants cumulatively affects interstate commerce by discouraging travel and harming economic activity.
- **Congress's Authority:** Contended that Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause extends to any local business whose practices, when aggregated with others, have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.

### Defendant/Appellee (McClung)

- **Local Activity:** Claimed that Ollie's Barbecue was a small, local business with minimal connection to interstate commerce, making it exempt from the Civil Rights Act.
- **Commerce Clause Limits:** Argued that the Civil Rights Act exceeded Congress’s authority by attempting to regulate purely local activities.

---

## Disposition

- **Unanimous Decision:** The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Katzenbach, upholding the application of the Civil Rights Act to local businesses like Ollie's Barbecue.

---

## Legal Reasoning

- **Substantial Effects Doctrine:** The Court held that even small, local businesses could be regulated under the Commerce Clause if their activities, in aggregate, had a substantial effect on interstate commerce.
- **Connection to Interstate Commerce:** Ollie's Barbecue sourced food from interstate suppliers, and racial discrimination in restaurants discouraged interstate travel, thereby affecting interstate commerce.
- **Civil Rights Enforcement:** The Court emphasized that Congress’s goal in enacting the Civil Rights Act was to eliminate barriers to commerce and travel caused by racial discrimination, which justified its application to local businesses.

## Rule of Law
