## Basic Information

Case: West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency

Parties:  
- **Plaintiff/Appellant:** State of West Virginia, et al.  
- **Defendant/Appellee:** Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

Citation: 597 U.S. ___ (2022)

Court: Supreme Court of the United States

Year: 2022

Judge/Author: Chief Justice John Roberts authored the majority opinion.

## Laws and Statutes Applied

- **Clean Air Act (CAA):** Federal statute aimed at controlling air pollution on a national level, empowering the EPA to regulate emissions of hazardous air pollutants from stationary and mobile sources.
- **Administrative Procedure Act (APA):** Governs the process by which federal agencies develop and issue regulations, including requirements for notice-and-comment rulemaking.
- **Major Questions Doctrine:** A judicial doctrine requiring clear congressional authorization for agency actions that have vast economic and political significance, used to scrutinize broad assertions of regulatory power.

## Facts of the Case

- The case challenged the EPA's authority to regulate carbon emissions from existing power plants under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act, as outlined in the Clean Power Plan (CPP) initiated during the Obama administration. The CPP aimed to shift energy production from coal to cleaner energy sources by setting stringent emissions reduction targets.
- West Virginia and other states argued that the EPA’s expansive approach to carbon regulation, which included setting caps on emissions that effectively restructured the nation's energy sector, exceeded the statutory authority granted by the Clean Air Act.
- The EPA contended that Section 111(d) granted it broad discretion to implement the “best system of emission reduction” for power plants, which included generation-shifting mechanisms as part of a comprehensive strategy to combat climate change.

## Procedural History

- The CPP was stayed by the Supreme Court in 2016 before it took effect. Under the Trump administration, the EPA repealed the CPP, replacing it with the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule, which was later challenged and vacated by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
- The Supreme Court granted certiorari to address the limits of the EPA’s regulatory authority under the Clean Air Act, specifically focusing on the extent to which the agency could mandate systemic changes to the energy sector without explicit congressional authorization.

## Question

1. Does the EPA have the authority under the Clean Air Act to adopt regulatory measures that fundamentally reshape the nation’s energy policy by compelling a shift away from coal-fired power generation towards cleaner energy sources without clear congressional authorization?

## Arguments

### Plaintiff/Appellant

- West Virginia argued that the Clean Air Act did not authorize the EPA to impose regulations that effectively mandated changes in the nation’s energy mix, asserting that such decisions were within the purview of Congress, not an administrative agency.
- The state emphasized the Major Questions Doctrine, contending that the EPA’s actions represented a vast expansion of regulatory power with significant economic and political implications, lacking clear and unambiguous congressional authorization.
- West Virginia also argued that the EPA’s approach usurped state authority to regulate power generation within their borders, violating principles of federalism and intruding on the states' traditional control over local utilities.

### Defendant/Appellee

- The EPA defended its regulatory approach under Section 111(d), arguing that it was within its authority to determine the “best system of emission reduction” based on contemporary environmental and technological realities, including generation-shifting measures.
- The agency argued that the Clean Air Act’s broad language empowered it to take comprehensive action to address carbon emissions from power plants, including systemic changes necessary to mitigate climate change.
- The EPA further contended that its regulatory approach was consistent with the statutory goal of reducing harmful pollutants from the power sector and that the agency’s expertise in environmental policy justified its discretion in determining the most effective regulatory strategies.

## Disposition

- The Supreme Court ruled in favor of West Virginia, holding that the EPA had exceeded its authority under the Clean Air Act. The decision significantly curtailed the agency’s ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions without explicit congressional authorization.

## Legal Reasoning

- The Court emphasized the Major Questions Doctrine, highlighting that the EPA’s regulatory approach sought to make transformative changes to the nation’s energy policy, a matter of such economic and political magnitude that it required clear congressional approval.
- Chief Justice Roberts stated that while the Clean Air Act allows the EPA to regulate power plant emissions, it does not authorize the agency to mandate generation-shifting on a scale that significantly alters the balance of state and federal authority over energy policy.
- The opinion stressed the need for Congress to speak clearly when assigning regulatory power of such sweeping nature to an agency, reinforcing that agencies cannot assume authority over major questions without explicit legislative delegation.

## Rule of Law

- Federal agencies cannot unilaterally assume broad regulatory powers that significantly impact the nation’s economy and political landscape without clear and specific congressional authorization, particularly when those actions implicate major questions of public policy.

## Concurring Opinion(s)

Author: Justice Neil Gorsuch  
Key Points:  
- Gorsuch emphasized the importance of the Major Questions Doctrine in preserving the separation of powers, arguing that allowing agencies to make far-reaching decisions without clear congressional input undermines democratic accountability and oversteps constitutional boundaries.

## Dissenting Opinion(s)

Author: Justice Elena Kagan  
Key Points:  
- Kagan argued that the Clean Air Act provided the EPA with the flexibility needed to address pressing environmental challenges, including regulating carbon emissions through generation-shifting measures. She contended that the Court’s decision hampered the EPA’s ability to fulfill its statutory mandate to protect public health and the environment from significant pollutants.

## Key Terms and Definitions

- **Major Questions Doctrine:** A principle that requires clear congressional authorization for agency actions with significant economic and political consequences, particularly when agencies assert broad regulatory powers.
- **Generation-Shifting:** Regulatory strategies that encourage or compel a shift from higher-emitting energy sources, such as coal, to cleaner alternatives like natural gas, wind, and solar.

## Questions/Ambiguities

- The decision leaves open how future regulations addressing environmental and public health concerns will be shaped by the constraints of the Major Questions Doctrine, particularly in areas where Congress has not provided explicit statutory guidance.

## Related Cases

- **Massachusetts v. EPA (2007):** Recognized the EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants under the Clean Air Act, but did not address the scope of regulatory measures permissible without explicit congressional authorization.
- **Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA (2014):** Limited the EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, reinforcing that agencies cannot interpret statutory language in ways that vastly expand their regulatory scope without clear authorization.
- **Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. (1984):** Established the principle of deference to agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes, though increasingly scrutinized under the Major Questions Doctrine when broad regulatory powers are asserted.
