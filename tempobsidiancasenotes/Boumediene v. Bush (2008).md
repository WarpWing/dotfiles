## Basic Information

Case: Boumediene v. Bush

Parties:  
- **Plaintiff/Appellant:** Lakhdar Boumediene, et al.  
- **Defendant/Appellee:** George W. Bush, President of the United States, et al.

Citation: 553 U.S. 723 (2008)

Court: Supreme Court of the United States

Year: 2008

Judge/Author: Justice Anthony Kennedy authored the majority opinion.

## Laws and Statutes Applied

- **Military Commissions Act (MCA) of 2006:** Restricted the ability of detainees designated as enemy combatants to challenge their detention in U.S. federal courts, specifically suspending habeas corpus rights for non-citizens held at Guantanamo Bay.
- **Detainee Treatment Act (DTA) of 2005:** Established specific procedures for reviewing the status of detainees but limited judicial review of military decisions.
- **Suspension Clause (Article I, Section 9, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution):** Prohibits the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus except in cases of rebellion or invasion when the public safety requires it.

## Facts of the Case

- Lakhdar Boumediene, an Algerian citizen, was captured in Bosnia and detained by the U.S. government at Guantanamo Bay as an enemy combatant. Boumediene, along with other detainees, filed a petition for habeas corpus in U.S. federal court, challenging the legality of their detention.
- In response to prior rulings that extended habeas corpus rights to Guantanamo detainees, Congress passed the Military Commissions Act (MCA) of 2006, which explicitly stripped federal courts of jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus petitions from non-citizens held as enemy combatants at Guantanamo Bay.
- Boumediene argued that the suspension of habeas corpus rights violated the U.S. Constitution’s Suspension Clause and that the procedures provided by the Detainee Treatment Act were insufficient to protect his rights.

## Procedural History

- The District Court dismissed Boumediene’s petition, citing the MCA’s restrictions on habeas corpus for enemy combatants. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal, ruling that Guantanamo detainees were not entitled to habeas corpus protections under U.S. law.
- The case was appealed to the Supreme Court, where the key question was whether the MCA’s suspension of habeas corpus for detainees at Guantanamo Bay was constitutional.

## Question

1. Does the Military Commissions Act of 2006, which denies habeas corpus rights to non-citizens held at Guantanamo Bay, violate the Suspension Clause of the U.S. Constitution?

## Arguments

### Plaintiff/Appellant

- Boumediene argued that the Suspension Clause of the U.S. Constitution protects the right to habeas corpus for all individuals held by the U.S. government, regardless of their location or nationality. He contended that Guantanamo Bay, being under the complete control of the U.S., should fall within the scope of U.S. law.
- Boumediene also argued that the review procedures provided by the Detainee Treatment Act were inadequate, as they did not provide a meaningful opportunity for detainees to challenge the legality of their detention in a neutral and independent court.

### Defendant/Appellee

- The U.S. government argued that Guantanamo Bay, being outside U.S. sovereign territory, did not entitle detainees to constitutional protections such as habeas corpus. The government contended that the procedures outlined in the MCA and DTA provided sufficient review for enemy combatants.
- The government maintained that the political branches (Congress and the President) had the authority to decide which legal protections apply to foreign nationals detained outside the United States, and that the courts should defer to the executive in matters of national security.

## Disposition

- The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Boumediene, holding that the MCA’s suspension of habeas corpus for detainees at Guantanamo Bay was unconstitutional. The Court found that Guantanamo detainees were entitled to challenge their detention through habeas corpus in U.S. federal courts.

## Legal Reasoning

- Justice Kennedy’s majority opinion emphasized that the Suspension Clause applies to all persons under U.S. control, regardless of their citizenship or location. The Court reasoned that because Guantanamo Bay is effectively under U.S. jurisdiction, detainees held there are entitled to habeas corpus protections.
- The Court held that the procedures outlined in the MCA and DTA were insufficient to protect the detainees' rights, as they did not provide a meaningful opportunity to challenge the legality of their detention. The Court ruled that the constitutional right to habeas corpus could not be suspended without adequate justification, and that the government’s argument about the location of Guantanamo Bay was not enough to deny detainees their rights.
- The decision reinforced the principle that even in matters of national security, the executive branch cannot unilaterally suspend constitutional protections for individuals held in U.S. custody.

## Rule of Law

- The constitutional right to habeas corpus extends to non-citizens detained at Guantanamo Bay, a U.S.-controlled territory. Any suspension of this right must comply with the Suspension Clause, and detainees must have the ability to challenge their detention before a neutral court.

## Concurring Opinion(s)

No concurring opinions were filed in this case.

## Dissenting Opinion(s)

Author: Justice Antonin Scalia (joined by Justices Roberts, Thomas, and Alito)  
Key Points:  
- Justice Scalia dissented, arguing that the Court’s decision would interfere with the executive branch’s ability to effectively conduct the war on terror. He contended that extending habeas corpus rights to enemy combatants captured abroad would undermine national security and create dangerous legal precedents. Scalia also argued that Congress had properly exercised its authority in passing the MCA and that the courts should defer to the political branches in matters of foreign policy and military operations.

## Key Terms and Definitions

- **Habeas Corpus:** A legal writ that allows individuals to challenge the legality of their detention before a court.
- **Suspension Clause:** A provision in the U.S. Constitution that protects the right to habeas corpus, allowing its suspension only in cases of rebellion or invasion when the public safety requires it.
- **Military Commissions Act (MCA):** A federal law that established military commissions to try enemy combatants and limited the jurisdiction of U.S. courts to hear habeas corpus petitions from detainees.

## Questions/Ambiguities

- The decision leaves open questions about the balance between national security and individual rights during times of war, particularly with regard to detainees held in U.S. custody outside the mainland. The ruling also raises issues about the future of military commissions and the extent to which Congress can limit judicial review of executive actions.
