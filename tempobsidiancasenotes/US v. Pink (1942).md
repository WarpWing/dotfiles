## Basic Information

Case: United States v. Pink

Parties:  
- **Plaintiff/Appellant:** United States of America  
- **Defendant/Appellee:** William H. Pink, Superintendent of Insurance for the State of New York

Citation: 315 U.S. 203 (1942)

Court: Supreme Court of the United States

Year: 1942

Judge/Author: Justice William O. Douglas authored the majority opinion.

## Laws and Statutes Applied

- **Litvinov Assignment (1933):** An agreement reached between the United States and the Soviet Union in which the Soviet government assigned certain assets held in the U.S. to the U.S. government as part of the normalization of relations between the two countries.
- **Supremacy Clause (Article VI, Clause 2) of the U.S. Constitution:** Establishes that federal laws and treaties are the supreme law of the land, overriding conflicting state laws.
- **Executive Agreements:** Informal agreements between the President and foreign nations that do not require Senate ratification, yet carry the force of law.

## Facts of the Case

- In 1933, the United States and the Soviet Union formally established diplomatic relations after decades of non-recognition. As part of the recognition process, the U.S. and Soviet governments negotiated the Litvinov Assignment, in which the Soviet Union assigned claims to assets of Russian companies located in the United States to the U.S. government.
- William H. Pink, Superintendent of Insurance for the State of New York, refused to release the assets of the First Russian Insurance Company to the U.S. government, claiming that New York law prevented the transfer of assets to foreign governments.
- The U.S. government sued to enforce the Litvinov Assignment, arguing that the executive agreement between the U.S. and the Soviet Union took precedence over New York law.

## Procedural History

- The case was initially brought in a New York state court, where the court ruled in favor of Pink, upholding New York’s claim to the assets. The United States appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, arguing that the Litvinov Assignment, as an executive agreement, superseded state law.

## Question

1. Does an executive agreement between the President and a foreign nation, such as the Litvinov Assignment, take precedence over state law under the Supremacy Clause?

## Arguments

### Plaintiff/Appellant

- The United States argued that the Litvinov Assignment, as part of an executive agreement with the Soviet Union, was binding on the states under the Supremacy Clause. Since the agreement was made to resolve issues of foreign affairs and international diplomacy, it fell within the President’s exclusive powers in that realm.
- The U.S. contended that the assets assigned under the Litvinov Assignment were part of an international agreement and thus could not be subject to conflicting state laws. Allowing states to interfere in foreign affairs would undermine the federal government’s ability to speak with one voice in international matters.

### Defendant/Appellee

- Pink argued that New York law, which governed the disposition of assets within its jurisdiction, prevented the transfer of the assets to the U.S. government. He maintained that the state’s power to regulate insurance companies was paramount in this case and that the federal government could not override state law without proper constitutional authority.
- Pink further argued that an executive agreement, unlike a treaty, did not carry the same legal weight as formal legislation or ratified treaties and therefore should not be able to override state law.

## Disposition

- The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the United States, holding that the Litvinov Assignment, as an executive agreement, took precedence over New York state law under the Supremacy Clause.

## Legal Reasoning

- Justice Douglas’ majority opinion emphasized that the Constitution grants the federal government, particularly the executive branch, broad authority in matters of foreign affairs. The Court reiterated that in issues concerning foreign relations, the federal government must be able to act independently of conflicting state laws.
- The Court held that executive agreements, even though they do not require Senate ratification like treaties, still carry the force of federal law under the Supremacy Clause. The Litvinov Assignment, as part of an international agreement, was binding on all states, including New York.
- The opinion reinforced the idea that in matters of foreign relations, the federal government must speak with one voice, and state laws cannot interfere with the execution of international agreements.

## Rule of Law

- Executive agreements between the United States and foreign nations have the force of law under the Supremacy Clause, and thus take precedence over conflicting state laws. The federal government’s authority in foreign affairs cannot be undermined by individual state regulations.

## Concurring Opinion(s)

No concurring opinions were filed in this case.

## Dissenting Opinion(s)

No dissenting opinions were filed in this case.

## Key Terms and Definitions

- **Executive Agreement:** An agreement made between the President and a foreign nation that does not require Senate ratification, but is still binding under U.S. law.
- **Supremacy Clause:** A constitutional provision stating that federal laws, treaties, and agreements are the supreme law of the land, overriding conflicting state laws.
- **Foreign Affairs Power:** The executive branch’s constitutional authority to manage international relations and agreements without interference from state governments.

## Questions/Ambiguities

- The case raises questions about the extent of the President’s power to make binding international agreements through executive actions and whether there are any limits to such agreements when they conflict with state laws.
