**Court:** United States Supreme Court

**Year:** 1942

**Judge/Author:** Justice Robert H. Jackson

## Laws Applied

- **Commerce Clause** (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the U.S. Constitution)
- **Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938**

---

## Facts of the Case

- Roscoe Filburn, a small Ohio farmer, grew wheat on his farm for personal consumption, exceeding his quota set under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938.
- The Act aimed to stabilize wheat prices by controlling supply, and Filburn was fined for growing more wheat than allowed.
- Filburn argued that the wheat he grew for personal use was not subject to federal regulation as it did not enter interstate commerce.

---

## Procedural History

- The lower courts ruled in favor of Filburn, holding that the government could not regulate wheat grown for personal consumption.
- The United States, represented by Secretary of Agriculture Wickard, appealed the case to the Supreme Court.

## Question(s)

1. **Does Congress have the power under the Commerce Clause to regulate wheat production intended for personal use and not sold in interstate commerce?**
2. **Can activities that are local and seemingly trivial still be regulated by Congress if they have a substantial effect on interstate commerce in the aggregate?**

---

## Arguments

### Plaintiff/Appellant (Wickard)

- **Aggregate Effect on Commerce:** Argued that even if Filburn’s wheat was for personal use, it affects interstate commerce in the aggregate by reducing the amount of wheat he would otherwise purchase.
- **Commerce Clause Scope:** Contended that Congress has the authority to regulate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce, even if the activities themselves are local and non-commercial.

### Defendant/Appellee (Filburn)

- **Local Activity:** Claimed that growing wheat for personal consumption is a purely local activity that does not directly affect interstate commerce and is thus beyond Congress’s regulatory power under the Commerce Clause.
- **Overreach of Federal Power:** Argued that the Agricultural Adjustment Act unconstitutionally extended federal power into areas reserved for the states under the Tenth Amendment.

---

## Disposition

- **Unanimous Decision:** The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Wickard, holding that Congress can regulate local activities if, in the aggregate, they have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.

---

## Legal Reasoning

- **Substantial Effects Doctrine:** The Court held that even activities that are local and not directly commercial can be regulated by Congress if they have a substantial effect on interstate commerce when considered in the aggregate.
- **Broad Commerce Power:** Filburn's wheat production, though small and for personal use, could affect the national wheat market by reducing demand. This was sufficient for Congress to exercise its commerce power.
- **Economic Impact:** The Court emphasized that the cumulative impact of similar local activities could disrupt interstate commerce, justifying federal regulation.

---

## Rule of Law

- **Congress may regulate local activities under the Commerce Clause if, in the aggregate, those activities have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.**
- **The Commerce Clause grants broad authority to regulate economic activities, even if those activities are not directly part of interstate commerce.**
