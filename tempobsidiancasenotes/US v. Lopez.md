## Laws Applied

- **Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990** (18 U.S.C. § 922(q))

---

## Facts of the Case

- Alfonso Lopez, Jr., a 12th-grade student, carried a concealed handgun onto the premises of his high school in San Antonio, Texas.
- Lopez was charged under the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, which made it a federal crime to possess a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school.
- Lopez challenged the constitutionality of the law, arguing that Congress lacked the authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate gun possession in local school zones.

---

## Procedural History

- Lopez was convicted in federal district court for violating the Gun-Free School Zones Act.
- On appeal, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the conviction, ruling that the Gun-Free School Zones Act exceeded Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause.
- The United States appealed to the Supreme Court.

## Question(s)

1. **Does Congress have the authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate gun possession in school zones?**

---

## Arguments

### Plaintiff/Appellant (United States)

- **Commerce Clause Scope:** Argued that the possession of firearms in school zones substantially affects interstate commerce by threatening the safety and quality of education, which in turn impacts the economy.
- **National Concerns:** Asserted that gun violence in schools is a national problem with economic consequences, justifying federal regulation.

### Defendant/Appellee (Lopez)

- **Local Issue:** Argued that the possession of a gun in a local school zone is not an economic activity that affects interstate commerce.
- **Exceeds Commerce Clause Power:** Contended that the Gun-Free School Zones Act exceeds Congress’s authority under the Commerce Clause, as gun possession in schools does not substantially affect interstate commerce.

---

## Disposition

- **5-4 Decision:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit’s ruling, striking down the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 as an unconstitutional exercise of Congress's Commerce Clause power.

---

## Legal Reasoning

- **Limits of Commerce Power:** The Court held that Congress's power under the Commerce Clause is not unlimited and that the possession of a firearm in a school zone is a non-economic activity that does not substantially affect interstate commerce.
- **Three Categories of Commerce Clause Regulation:** The Court identified three broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate under the Commerce Clause: (1) channels of interstate commerce, (2) instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and (3) activities that have a substantial relation to interstate commerce.
- **Gun-Free School Zones Act Invalid:** The Court found that the Gun-Free School Zones Act fell outside these categories because it regulated noneconomic, criminal activity that had no significant impact on interstate commerce.
- **Federalism Concerns:** The decision emphasized the importance of maintaining the distinction between federal and state powers, noting that criminal laws and education are traditionally state concerns.

---

## Rule of Law

- **Congress may not regulate non-economic activities under the Commerce Clause unless those activities have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.**
- **The possession of a firearm in a local school zone does not substantially affect interstate commerce, making the Gun-Free School Zones Act unconstitutional.**

---

## Concurring Opinion(s)

**Author:** Justice Clarence Thomas

**Key Points:**

- Justice Thomas argued that the Commerce Clause has been interpreted too broadly in recent decades and called for a return to a more originalist understanding of the clause’s limits.

---

## Dissenting Opinion(s)

**Author:** Justice Stephen Breyer (joined by Justices Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg)

**Key Points:**

- **Substantial Effects Test:** Justice Breyer argued that gun violence in schools substantially affects interstate commerce by disrupting the educational process, which has a clear link to the national economy.
- **Rational Basis:** He maintained that Congress had a rational basis for concluding that gun possession in school zones would have an effect on interstate commerce, and thus the Gun-Free School Zones Act was a constitutional exercise of federal power.

---

## Questions/Ambiguities

- **Commerce Clause Boundaries:** How should courts determine the extent of Congress’s authority to regulate non-economic activities under the Commerce Clause?
- **Impact on Future Legislation:** How does this decision affect Congress's ability to pass federal legislation addressing issues traditionally considered local, such as crime and education?
