## Basic Information

Case: Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States

Parties:  
- **Plaintiff/Appellant:** Schechter Poultry Corporation  
- **Defendant/Appellee:** United States of America

Citation: 295 U.S. 495 (1935)

Court: Supreme Court of the United States

Year: 1935

Judge/Author: Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes authored the majority opinion.

## Laws and Statutes Applied

- **National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933:** A key piece of New Deal legislation that authorized the President to regulate industry in an attempt to stimulate economic recovery, including setting wages, prices, and standards for working conditions.
- **Commerce Clause:** Grants Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states, which was invoked as the constitutional basis for the NIRA’s sweeping regulatory powers.
- **Nondelegation Doctrine:** A constitutional principle that prohibits Congress from delegating its legislative powers to another branch of government without clear and specific guidelines.

## Facts of the Case

- The Schechter Poultry Corporation was charged with violating the Live Poultry Code, a set of regulations established under the NIRA. The Code set industry-wide standards, including wage and hour requirements, trade practices, and health and safety standards, intended to stabilize the poultry market and protect workers.
- Schechter was accused of selling sick chickens, violating wage and hour provisions, and allowing customers to select individual chickens, which was prohibited under the Code’s trade practice regulations. The company challenged the constitutionality of the NIRA, arguing that it granted excessive regulatory power to the executive branch.
- The government argued that the NIRA was a necessary response to the economic emergency of the Great Depression and was within Congress’s power to regulate interstate commerce, as the poultry industry had substantial effects on national markets.

## Procedural History

- Schechter was convicted in the District Court for violating the Live Poultry Code. The conviction was upheld by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which found the NIRA constitutional. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court, challenging the validity of the NIRA and the delegation of legislative power to the executive branch.

## Question

1. Did the National Industrial Recovery Act violate the Constitution by delegating legislative power to the President without clear guidelines, and did the Act’s regulation of intrastate commerce exceed Congress’s powers under the Commerce Clause?

## Arguments

### Plaintiff/Appellant

- Schechter argued that the NIRA unlawfully delegated legislative power to the President by allowing him to establish industry codes without clear standards or congressional oversight, violating the separation of powers mandated by the Constitution.
- The company contended that its operations were purely intrastate, as the poultry sold in New York was sourced and distributed within the state, and thus did not constitute interstate commerce subject to federal regulation.
- Schechter also argued that the NIRA’s broad regulatory scheme was not a valid exercise of Congress’s Commerce Clause powers, as it attempted to control local business practices unrelated to interstate commerce.

### Defendant/Appellee

- The United States argued that the NIRA was a critical component of the New Deal’s efforts to combat the economic devastation of the Great Depression, and that Congress had the authority to regulate industry-wide standards to stabilize the national economy.
- The government contended that the poultry industry affected interstate commerce indirectly by influencing national supply chains, prices, and labor conditions, justifying federal regulation under the Commerce Clause.
- The government also argued that the delegation of authority to the President was necessary due to the urgent economic crisis and that Congress retained ultimate oversight by setting broad policy goals and retaining the power to amend or repeal the Act.

## Disposition

- The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Schechter Poultry Corporation, striking down the NIRA as unconstitutional. The Court found that the Act violated the nondelegation doctrine and exceeded Congress’s regulatory authority under the Commerce Clause.

## Legal Reasoning

- Chief Justice Hughes’s opinion emphasized that the NIRA’s delegation of legislative power to the President was unprecedented and lacked the clear standards or guidelines required to ensure that Congress retained control over the regulatory process, violating the nondelegation doctrine.
- The Court held that the regulation of Schechter’s operations fell outside the scope of the Commerce Clause because the activities were purely intrastate and had only an indirect effect on interstate commerce, which was insufficient to justify federal intervention.
- The decision underscored the importance of maintaining the separation of powers, stressing that Congress cannot abdicate its legislative responsibilities by granting the executive branch broad authority to regulate industries without precise limitations or safeguards.

## Rule of Law

- Congress cannot delegate its legislative powers to the executive branch without providing clear and specific guidelines to direct the exercise of that authority. Additionally, the regulation of intrastate activities that do not directly affect interstate commerce exceeds the scope of Congress’s powers under the Commerce Clause.

## Concurring Opinion(s)

No concurring opinions were filed, as the decision was unanimous.

## Dissenting Opinion(s)

No dissenting opinions were filed, as the decision was unanimous.

## Key Terms and Definitions

- **Nondelegation Doctrine:** A constitutional principle that prohibits Congress from delegating its legislative powers to another branch of government without clear, specific, and intelligible guidelines.
- **Commerce Clause:** The provision of the Constitution that grants Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states, limited to activities that directly affect interstate commerce.

## Questions/Ambiguities

- The ruling left open questions about the extent to which Congress can delegate regulatory authority to administrative agencies, particularly during times of national emergency, and how to define the boundaries of interstate commerce.
