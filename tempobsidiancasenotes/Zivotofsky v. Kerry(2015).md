## Basic Information

Case: Zivotofsky v. Kerry

Parties:  
- **Plaintiff/Appellant:** Menachem Binyamin Zivotofsky, by his parents  
- **Defendant/Appellee:** John Kerry, U.S. Secretary of State

Citation: 576 U.S. 1 (2015)

Court: Supreme Court of the United States

Year: 2015

Judge/Author: Justice Anthony Kennedy authored the majority opinion.

## Laws and Statutes Applied

- **Foreign Relations Authorization Act (2002), Section 214(d):** Allowed U.S. citizens born in Jerusalem to list "Israel" as their place of birth on their passports, in contradiction to longstanding U.S. policy not to officially recognize any country's sovereignty over Jerusalem.
- **Article II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution:** Grants the President the exclusive power to "receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers," a key component of the executive’s recognition power.
- **Separation of Powers Doctrine:** Ensures the division of governmental authority among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches, with checks and balances to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful.

## Facts of the Case

- Menachem Zivotofsky was born in Jerusalem in 2002. His parents requested that the U.S. State Department list "Israel" as his place of birth on his passport, relying on Section 214(d) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, which allowed U.S. citizens born in Jerusalem to do so.
- The State Department refused, citing the executive branch’s long-standing policy of neutrality regarding the status of Jerusalem, in line with U.S. foreign policy that does not recognize any country’s sovereignty over the city.
- Zivotofsky's parents sued, arguing that Congress had the authority to regulate passports and that the executive branch was obligated to follow the law enacted by Congress.

## Procedural History

- The lower courts initially dismissed the case as a political question, but the Supreme Court ruled in *Zivotofsky 
- I* (2012) that the case was justiciable and should be heard on its merits. The case returned to the District Court and then to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, both of which upheld the executive branch's authority.
- The case was then appealed to the Supreme Court to decide whether Congress, through the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, could compel the executive branch to contradict its policy regarding the recognition of foreign sovereignty over Jerusalem.

## Question

1. Does Congress have the power to require the State Department to record "Israel" as the place of birth for U.S. citizens born in Jerusalem, or is the recognition of foreign sovereigns an exclusive power of the President under the Constitution?

## Arguments

### Plaintiff/Appellant

- Zivotofsky’s parents argued that Congress had the authority to regulate passports under its enumerated powers, including the power over naturalization and citizenship, and that Section 214(d) was a valid exercise of this authority.
- They contended that listing "Israel" as the place of birth for U.S. citizens born in Jerusalem did not amount to formal recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the city, and that the President’s recognition power did not extend to every aspect of foreign policy.

### Defendant/Appellee

- The State Department argued that the President holds the exclusive power to recognize foreign sovereigns, as established by Article II of the Constitution. The government contended that forcing the executive to list "Israel" on passports of citizens born in Jerusalem would contradict the President's recognition policy and undermine U.S. foreign policy in a sensitive diplomatic area.
- The executive branch maintained that Section 214(d) was an unconstitutional encroachment on the President’s exclusive power to recognize foreign states and determine the U.S. position on sovereignty over disputed territories.

## Disposition

- The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the State Department, holding that the President has the exclusive power to recognize foreign nations, and that Congress cannot compel the executive branch to act in a way that contradicts this recognition power.

## Legal Reasoning

- Justice Kennedy’s majority opinion emphasized that the President’s recognition power is an exclusive executive function derived from the Constitution. This power includes the ability to determine how the United States will identify foreign sovereigns and disputed territories like Jerusalem.
- The Court held that Congress had overstepped its constitutional bounds by enacting Section 214(d), which effectively required the executive to take a position on Jerusalem’s status that contradicted longstanding U.S. foreign policy. The ruling reaffirmed the separation of powers, underscoring the President’s preeminence in the conduct of foreign relations.
- The opinion further emphasized that the recognition power is not shared with Congress, and Congress cannot enact laws that directly interfere with the executive’s decisions on recognition, as doing so would disrupt the balance of powers.

## Rule of Law

- The President has the exclusive power to recognize foreign sovereigns, including determining the U.S. position on the sovereignty of disputed territories. Congress cannot pass laws that contradict the executive branch's recognition decisions, as such laws violate the separation of powers and encroach upon the President's authority in foreign relations.

## Concurring Opinion(s)

Author: Justice Stephen Breyer  
Key Points:  
- Justice Breyer concurred in part, focusing on the practical implications of the decision. He argued that foreign policy decisions of this magnitude are best left to the political branches, and that Congress’s attempt to legislate on this matter was inappropriate given the sensitive nature of the recognition power.

## Dissenting Opinion(s)

Author: Justice Antonin Scalia (joined by Justices Alito and Thomas)  
Key Points:  
- Justice Scalia dissented, arguing that Congress had the power to regulate passports and that Section 214(d) did not amount to formal recognition of foreign sovereignty. He contended that the law merely allowed citizens born in Jerusalem to self-identify,
