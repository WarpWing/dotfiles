## Basic Information

Case: United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corporation

Parties:  
- **Plaintiff/Appellant:** United States of America  
- **Defendant/Appellee:** Curtiss-Wright Export Corporation

Citation: 299 U.S. 304 (1936)

Court: Supreme Court of the United States

Year: 1936

Judge/Author: Justice George Sutherland authored the majority opinion.

## Laws and Statutes Applied

- **Joint Resolution of Congress (1934):** Authorized the President to prohibit the sale of arms to countries involved in the Chaco War between Bolivia and Paraguay, giving the President discretion to enforce the embargo.
- **Article II of the U.S. Constitution:** Outlines the powers of the executive branch, including the President's role in conducting foreign affairs.
- **Separation of Powers Doctrine:** A principle dividing governmental powers among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful.

## Facts of the Case

- In 1934, Congress passed a joint resolution granting President Franklin D. Roosevelt the authority to prohibit the sale of arms to nations engaged in the Chaco War, a conflict between Bolivia and Paraguay. The resolution allowed the President to determine when such an embargo was necessary for maintaining peace.
- Curtiss-Wright Export Corporation, an arms manufacturer, violated the embargo by selling military equipment to Bolivia. The U.S. government charged Curtiss-Wright with criminal conspiracy to violate the arms embargo.
- Curtiss-Wright challenged the constitutionality of the joint resolution, arguing that Congress had unlawfully delegated legislative powers to the President by allowing him to unilaterally impose an embargo without specific standards or guidance.

## Procedural History

- The District Court ruled in favor of Curtiss-Wright, holding that the delegation of authority to the President was unconstitutional. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court to determine whether Congress could delegate such powers to the President in matters of foreign affairs.

## Question

1. Did the joint resolution of Congress granting the President discretionary authority to impose an arms embargo in foreign affairs constitute an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power?

## Arguments

### Plaintiff/Appellant

- The U.S. government argued that the delegation of power to the President was constitutionally permissible in the realm of foreign affairs, where the executive branch traditionally holds significant authority to act on behalf of the nation.
- The government contended that foreign policy decisions require flexibility and discretion, and that the President is uniquely positioned to handle sensitive diplomatic and international matters, making the delegation appropriate.
- The government emphasized that the embargo was a matter of international relations, an area in which the President’s powers are broader than in domestic affairs, and that the delegation was necessary to protect national interests in peace and stability.

### Defendant/Appellee

- Curtiss-Wright argued that Congress had unlawfully delegated its legislative powers to the President by giving him unchecked discretion to decide when and how to enforce the embargo.
- The defendant contended that such a delegation violated the separation of powers, as it allowed the executive to make law without adequate guidance or standards from Congress.
- Curtiss-Wright further argued that the delegation of legislative authority in foreign affairs should be subject to the same constitutional limitations as domestic delegations of power, requiring clear guidelines and oversight.

## Disposition

- The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the United States, upholding the joint resolution and the President’s authority to impose the embargo. The Court found that Congress’s delegation of power to the President in matters of foreign affairs was constitutional.

## Legal Reasoning

- Justice Sutherland’s opinion emphasized that the President holds inherent and broad powers in the realm of foreign affairs that are distinct from those exercised in domestic matters. The Court distinguished between the limited delegations permissible in domestic policy and the broader discretion afforded to the executive in foreign relations.
- The Court noted that the President is the “sole organ” of the federal government in the field of international relations, possessing greater flexibility and autonomy in managing foreign policy. This inherent authority derives not only from statutory delegations by Congress but also from the President’s constitutional role as the nation’s representative in foreign affairs.
- The Court concluded that the delegation of power to the President in this case was appropriate because foreign policy decisions require swift and adaptable responses, which the legislative process is not always equipped to handle. The ruling reaffirmed the President’s dominant role in foreign affairs, even when acting on delegated congressional authority.

## Rule of Law

- The President possesses broad, inherent authority in the realm of foreign affairs, distinct from domestic powers, allowing for greater flexibility in decision-making. Delegations of power to the President in matters of foreign policy are constitutional, as the executive branch plays a central role
