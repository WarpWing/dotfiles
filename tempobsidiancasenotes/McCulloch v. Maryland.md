## Basic Information
Case: McCulloch v. Maryland
Parties: State of Maryland (Plaintiff) v. James W. McCulloch (Defendant)
Citation: [17 U.S (4 Wheat) 316](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/17/316/)
Court: Marshall Court 
Year: 1819
Judge: Chief Justice John Marshall

## Laws Applied
- Necessary and Proper Clause
- Supremacy Clause
- 10th Amendment

## Facts of the Case
- The U.S. Congress created the Second Bank of the United States in 1816. A year later, the Bank opened a branch in Baltimore, Maryland, where it carried out all the normal operations of a bank.
- Legitimacy was based on the applicability of the U.S Constitution to Maryland.
- Maryland voted to impose a tax on all banks not charted by Maryland (this includes the Second Bank of the U.S)
- Head of the Second Bank (McCulloch) refused to comply against Maryland and forced Maryland to sue.

## Procedural History
- Maryland sued McCulloch for refusing to comply with the tax in state court
- Maryland successfully argued on appeal to the state appellate court because the Constitution did not provide a textual commitment for the federal government to charter a bank

## Question(s)
1. Does Congress have the authority to establish the Bank?  
2. Did the Maryland law unconstitutionally interfere with congressional power?

## Arguments
### Plaintiff/Appellant
- Maryland argued that the Constitution did not explicitly grant Congress the power to establish a national bank. They contended that the Necessary and Proper Clause should be interpreted narrowly, only allowing Congress to use means that are absolutely necessary to carry out its enumerated powers.
- The state claimed it had the sovereign right to tax any entity operating within its borders, including a federal bank branch.
- Maryland asserted that the 10th Amendment reserved to the states all powers not explicitly granted to the federal government, which should include the power to regulate and tax banks operating in the state.

### Defendant/Appellee
- McCulloch argued that the power to establish a national bank was implied by Congress's enumerated powers, particularly the powers to tax, borrow money, regulate commerce, and provide for the general welfare.
- The defendant claimed that the Necessary and Proper Clause should be interpreted broadly, allowing Congress to choose any means that are conducive to exercising its enumerated powers effectively.
- McCulloch contended that allowing states to tax federal institutions would give them the power to destroy or impede the operations of the federal government, violating the principle of federal supremacy.

## Legal Reasoning
- Chief Justice Marshall reasoned that the Constitution, by its nature, could only outline general powers and must allow for implied powers to be effective.
- He argued that the word "necessary" in the Necessary and Proper Clause did not mean "absolutely necessary" but rather "appropriate" or "conducive to" the execution of enumerated powers.
- Marshall invoked the Supremacy Clause to assert that states cannot interfere with the legitimate operations of the federal government, including its power to establish a national bank.
- The Court held that the power to tax involves the power to destroy, and allowing states to tax federal institutions would subordinate the federal government to state authority.

## Rule of Law
- Marshal invoked the Necessary and Proper Clause stating that Congress powers not explicitly outlined in the Constitution and redefined "necessary" to mean "appropriate and legitimate" and covering all methods for furthering objectives by the enumerating powers. Marshall also held that while states retain the right to tax, the Constitution and the laws made in pursuance would be under the Supremacy Clause and cannot be controlled the states

## Questions/Ambiguities
- How broadly should the Necessary and Proper Clause be interpreted in future cases involving implied powers of Congress?
- What are the limits, if any, on Congress's ability to create institutions or agencies not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution?
