## Basic Information

Case: Trump v. Hawaii

Parties:  
- **Plaintiff/Appellant:** State of Hawaii, et al.  
- **Defendant/Appellee:** Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al.

Citation: 585 U.S. ??? (2018)

Court: Supreme Court of the United States

Year: 2018

Judge/Author: Chief Justice John Roberts authored the majority opinion.

## Laws and Statutes Applied

- **Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) of 1952:** Governs U.S. immigration policy, including the President’s authority to suspend the entry of non-citizens deemed detrimental to the interests of the United States.
- **Presidential Proclamation 9645:** An executive order issued by President Trump restricting travel to the U.S. from several predominantly Muslim-majority countries on national security grounds.
- **Establishment Clause of the First Amendment:** Prohibits the government from establishing a religion, relevant in assessing claims of religious discrimination in executive actions.

## Facts of the Case

- In 2017, President Trump issued a series of executive orders and proclamations restricting travel from several predominantly Muslim-majority countries, citing national security concerns. Proclamation 9645 was the third iteration, placing entry restrictions on citizens of Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen.
- The State of Hawaii, several individuals, and a Muslim association challenged the proclamation, arguing that it exceeded the President’s authority under the INA and violated the Establishment Clause by discriminating against Muslims.
- Plaintiffs contended that the travel ban was motivated by anti-Muslim animus, pointing to statements made by President Trump during his campaign and presidency as evidence that the policy was not based on genuine national security concerns but rather religious discrimination.

## Procedural History

- The District Court issued a nationwide injunction blocking enforcement of the travel ban, which was partially upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The government appealed, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari to decide the constitutionality and statutory authority of the travel restrictions.

## Question

1. Does the President have the statutory authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act to issue a proclamation restricting entry into the United States on national security grounds, and does such a proclamation violate the Establishment Clause by discriminating against a particular religion?

## Arguments

### Plaintiff/Appellant

- The State of Hawaii argued that the travel ban exceeded the President’s authority under the INA, which requires that immigration restrictions be based on specific findings that the entry of certain groups would be detrimental to the national interest.
- Plaintiffs contended that the proclamation violated the Establishment Clause by targeting Muslims, using religion as a basis for the travel restrictions, and failing to provide a legitimate national security justification.
- They argued that President Trump’s statements and the context of the ban demonstrated clear religious animus, making the policy unconstitutional regardless of any security rationale provided in the proclamation.

### Defendant/Appellee

- The government argued that the INA granted the President broad discretion to suspend the entry of non-citizens when deemed necessary to protect national security, and that Proclamation 9645 was within this authority.
- The defense contended that the travel ban was based on a comprehensive review of national security risks, applying neutral criteria that assessed countries’ cooperation with U.S. vetting procedures and security standards.
- The government maintained that the proclamation was facially neutral and did not violate the Establishment Clause, emphasizing that it included non-Muslim-majority countries, demonstrating a valid security objective rather than religious discrimination.

## Disposition

- The Supreme Court ruled in favor of President Trump, upholding the travel ban as a lawful exercise of executive authority under the INA. The Court found that the proclamation was within the scope of the President’s statutory powers and did not violate the Establishment Clause.

## Legal Reasoning

- Chief Justice Roberts’ opinion emphasized the broad discretion granted to the President under the INA to regulate the entry of non-citizens when deemed necessary for national security. The Court deferred to the executive branch’s assessment of security threats, finding that the proclamation was based on legitimate findings rather than religious animus.
- The Court rejected the Establishment Clause challenge, noting that the text of the proclamation was neutral concerning religion and was justified by national security concerns. The inclusion of non-Muslim-majority countries in the ban supported the government’s argument that the policy was not solely targeting Muslims.
- The decision underscored the importance of judicial deference to the executive in matters of national security and immigration, recognizing the President’s authority to make determinations about entry restrictions without second-guessing the underlying motives absent clear evidence of bad faith.

## Rule of Law

- The President has broad statutory authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act to restrict entry into the United States based on national security concerns, and such actions are entitled to judicial deference. Policies that are facially neutral and grounded in legitimate security objectives do not violate the Establishment Clause, even if they have incidental effects on particular religious groups.

## Concurring Opinion(s)

Author: Justice Anthony Kennedy  
Key Points:  
- Justice Kennedy concurred, emphasizing that while the President’s actions were lawful, the government has a duty to adhere to constitutional protections against religious discrimination and to ensure that policies are not motivated by impermissible bias, cautioning against unchecked executive power.

## Dissenting Opinion(s)

Author: Justice Sonia Sotomayor  
Key Points:  
- Justice Sotomayor dissented, arguing that the travel ban was motivated by anti-Muslim bias, as evidenced by President Trump’s statements, and violated the Establishment Clause by endorsing hostility toward Islam. She contended that the Court’s decision failed to safeguard constitutional principles against religious discrimination.

## Key Terms and Definitions

- **Establishment Clause:** A constitutional provision prohibiting the government from favoring or discriminating against any religion, ensuring religious neutrality in governmental actions.
- **Judicial Deference:** The principle that courts should respect the expertise and judgment of executive branch officials in areas such as national security and foreign policy, particularly when statutory authority is broadly defined.
- **Immigration and Nationality Act:** The primary federal statute governing immigration law, including the powers of the President to suspend or restrict entry based on national interests.

## Questions/Ambiguities

- The ruling raises ongoing questions about the limits of executive power in immigration and national security, particularly when policies appear to impact specific religious or ethnic groups, and how courts should assess the validity of security justifications in the face of potential discriminatory intent.
