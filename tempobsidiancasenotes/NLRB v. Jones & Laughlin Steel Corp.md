## Basic Information

Case: NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp
Parties: National Labor Rights Board (Plaintiff ) v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation (Defendant) 
Citation: [301 US 1 (1937)](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1900-1940/301us1)
Court: Hughes Court
Year: 1937
Judge/Author: Chief Justice Charles E. Hughes
## Laws Applied 
-  Commerce Clause
-  NLRA Act of 1935  
- 

## Facts of the Case
- Ten employees at a Pennsylvanian Steel Plant of Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation (Jones) were fired after they tried to form a union.
- As a result, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) brought charges of discrimination against Jones  under the NLRA (National Labor Relations Act) of 1935.
- Due to unfair rulings by Jones and Laughlin, several strikes occurred during that period of time, which could arguably affect interstate commerce.
## Procedural History
-  After the NLRB filed charges, they demanded that Jones reinstate the workers and provide them with back pay +  other remedies. 
-  Jones refused to comply with the demands as they pointed out that the NLRB's action was unconstitutional and they (Jones) did not directly engage in interstate commerce, meaning that they were not covered by the Commerce Clause and thus not within the scope of the federal government's authority.

## Question(s)

1.  Does Congress have the power under the Commerce Clause to regulate labor relations in industries not directly engaged in interstate commerce?
2. In certain circumstances, can a President intimidate the court?
3. Should the Court adopt a broader role of interpretation of the Constitution?
4. What is the Purpose of the Law? Is it a Labor Statue disguised as a Regulatory Statue.

## Arguments

### Plaintiff/Appellant

-  The NLRA Act of 1935 does fall within Congress's power under the Commerce Clause to regulate interstate commerce.
-  Labor disputes in major industries like steel do affect interstate commerce by proxy, which justify federal regulation
-  The NLRA Act of 1935 also does not impermissibly infringe on state powers or violate substantive due process, it's a reasonable exercise of congressional power.

### Defendant/Appellee

- Manufacturing is an inherently local activity, not subject to federal regulation under the Commerce Clause.
- The NLRA Act of 1935 also infringes on powers reserved to the states under the 10th amendment.
-  The NLRA Act of 1935 could violate the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause by unduly restrict employer's freedom of contract.
- The NLRB's interpretation of "affecting commerce" goes beyond the statutory intent of Congress under the Commerce Clause.

## Disposition

-  In a 5-4 Majority, Hughes rights that companies cannot discriminate against employees for exercising their fundamental  (non enumerated) right to unionize. The Court upheld that it has the power to regulate industrial activity due to it's parent duty asserted under the Commerce Clause as while manufacturing is a local activity, any processes or relationship (such as labor and management) has an aggregate impact on commerce.

## Legal Reasoning

-   The Court adopted a broader interpretation of the Commerce Clause, forgoing the strictness of "direct" and "indirect" effects on interstate commerce.
- The Court found that Congress has a rational basis for enacting the NLRA Act of 1935 to address disputes that could burden or obstruct interstate commerce, in this case, the impact of labor would be subsequent effects on the national economy. 
- The Court also rejected arguments that the NLRA Act of 1935 did NOT violate Due Process Clause (5th) due to reasons of reasonable exercise (rational basis)

## Rule of Law

-  Congress has the authority to regulate intrastate activities that significantly affect interstate commerce, directly or indirectly

## Concurring Opinion(s)
Author: N/A (Chief Justice Hughes wrote the majority opinion)
Key Points:
- N/A (The key points of Hughes' opinion are represented in the majority decision)

## Dissenting Opinion(s)
Author: Justice McReynolds (joined by Justices Van Devanter, Sutherland, and Butler)
Key Points:
- The NLRA exceeds Congress's power under the Commerce Clause
- Manufacturing is inherently a local activity and not subject to federal regulation
- The Act infringes on the states' reserved powers under the Tenth Amendment
- The majority's interpretation dangerously expands federal power with no clear limits
- The Act violates employers' freedom of contract and property rights under the Due Process Clause
- The NLRB's powers are too broad and infringe on judicial authority
- The majority's decision ignores established precedents like United States v. E.C. Knight Co.
- The Act's definition of "affecting commerce" is overly broad and vague
- Federal regulation of labor relations in manufacturing will lead to centralization of government power
- The decision undermines the constitutional system of checks and balances

## Questions/Ambiguities

-  Does the NLRB's interpretation of "affecting commerce" goes beyond the statutory intent of Congress?
- Does the creation of the NLRB as an independent agency with quasi-judicial powers conflict with the separation of powers doctrine? 
- What are the boundaries of federal powers in regulating all local activities that might indirectly affect interstate commerce?
