## Arguments

### Plaintiff/Appellant (Heart of Atlanta Motel)

- **Commerce Clause Limits:** Argued that the Commerce Clause does not grant Congress the authority to regulate private businesses in selecting their customers.
- **Fifth Amendment:** Claimed that the Civil Rights Act violated the Fifth Amendment by depriving the Motel of property rights without due process of law.
- **Thirteenth Amendment:** Contended that enforcing the Civil Rights Act amounted to involuntary servitude under the Thirteenth Amendment by forcing the Motel to serve certain guests against its will.

### Defendant/Appellee (United States)

- **Interstate Commerce:** Argued that racial discrimination in accommodations has a significant effect on interstate commerce, which falls within Congress's regulatory authority under the Commerce Clause.
- **Congressional Power:** Asserted that the Civil Rights Act is a legitimate exercise of Congress's power to eliminate barriers to interstate travel and commerce.
