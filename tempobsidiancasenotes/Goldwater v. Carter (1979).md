## Basic Information

Case: Goldwater v. Carter

Parties:  
- **Plaintiff/Appellant:** Senator Barry Goldwater, et al.  
- **Defendant/Appellee:** Jimmy Carter, President of the United States

Citation: 444 U.S. 996 (1979)

Court: Supreme Court of the United States

Year: 1979

Judge/Author: The case was dismissed without a full written opinion, with multiple concurring and dissenting opinions issued.

## Laws and Statutes Applied

- **Article II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution:** Grants the President the power to make treaties with the advice and consent of the Senate, but does not explicitly state how treaties can be terminated.
- **Political Question Doctrine:** A judicial doctrine that holds that certain constitutional questions are best left to the political branches of government and are not suitable for judicial resolution.

## Facts of the Case

- In 1979, President Jimmy Carter unilaterally terminated the U.S. treaty with the Republic of China (Taiwan) as part of a diplomatic shift toward recognizing the People's Republic of China (PRC) as the legitimate government of China. This move was part of a broader strategy to normalize relations with the PRC.
- Senator Barry Goldwater, along with several other members of Congress, challenged President Carter's authority to terminate the treaty without seeking Senate approval. The plaintiffs argued that since the Senate plays a constitutional role in ratifying treaties, its consent should also be required to terminate them.
- The key question raised in the case was whether the President has the unilateral authority to terminate a treaty or whether this power is shared with Congress, specifically the Senate.

## Procedural History

- The case was initially filed in the U.S. District Court, which dismissed the claim on the grounds that it raised a political question. The case was then appealed directly to the Supreme Court, where the central issue was whether the termination of a treaty is a justiciable question that the courts can resolve.

## Question

1. Does the President have the constitutional authority to unilaterally terminate a treaty without the approval of the Senate, and is this a question that can be decided by the courts?

## Arguments

### Plaintiff/Appellant

- Senator Goldwater and his co-plaintiffs argued that the termination of a treaty, like its ratification, should require Senate involvement. They contended that the Constitution’s silence on treaty termination did not mean the President could act unilaterally, but instead implied that Congress should play a role in this decision, given its constitutional role in foreign affairs.
- The plaintiffs also asserted that allowing the President to terminate treaties without Senate consent would upset the balance of powers between the executive and legislative branches and give the President too much unchecked authority in foreign affairs.

### Defendant/Appellee

- President Carter’s administration argued that the Constitution grants the President broad powers in conducting foreign relations, including the authority to terminate treaties. The executive branch argued that treaty termination is an executive function and does not require the same congressional involvement as treaty ratification.
- The government also contended that this issue was a political question beyond the reach of the judiciary, emphasizing that matters of foreign relations are generally best left to the political branches of government.

## Disposition

- The Supreme Court dismissed the case, ruling that the issue was a political question and therefore not justiciable. The Court did not issue a full majority opinion, but instead issued a brief per curiam decision. The dismissal left unresolved the question of whether the President could terminate a treaty unilaterally.

## Legal Reasoning

- Several justices, including Justice William Rehnquist, concurred in the dismissal, arguing that the case presented a non-justiciable political question. The Court’s refusal to hear the case was grounded in the belief that treaty termination is a matter best resolved between the executive and legislative branches, rather than by the judiciary.
- Justice Powell concurred in the dismissal but emphasized that the issue was not ripe for judicial review because Congress had not taken any official action opposing the President’s decision. Powell suggested that if Congress had formally opposed the President’s termination of the treaty, the case might be more justiciable.
- The Court’s decision reinforced the idea that certain disputes over foreign policy and the separation of powers may not be suitable for judicial resolution and are better left to the political process.

## Rule of Law

- The case was dismissed based on the political question doctrine, leaving unresolved whether the President has the unilateral authority to terminate treaties. The decision affirmed that certain matters involving foreign policy and executive-legislative relations may be beyond the scope of judicial review.

## Concurring Opinion(s)

Author: Justice William Rehnquist (joined by Justices Stewart, Stevens, and Chief Justice Burger)  
Key Points:  
- Justice Rehnquist emphasized that the case raised a political question, making it non-justiciable. He argued that issues involving the President’s conduct of foreign affairs and treaty termination were political in nature and not suitable for judicial determination.

Author: Justice Lewis Powell  
Key Points:  
- Justice Powell concurred but argued that the case was not ripe for review because Congress had not yet taken formal action opposing the President’s decision. He suggested that a formal conflict between the President and Congress could potentially make the issue justiciable in the future.

## Dissenting Opinion(s)

Author: Justice William Brennan  
Key Points:  
- Justice Brennan dissented, arguing that the case was justiciable and that the Court should address the constitutional question. Brennan believed that the Constitution’s silence on treaty termination did not give the President unchecked authority in this area, and that the Court should define the respective roles of Congress and the President in treaty termination.

## Key Terms and Definitions

- **Political Question Doctrine:** A principle that holds that certain disputes, particularly those involving the separation of powers or foreign relations, are inappropriate for judicial resolution and should be left to the political branches of government.
- **Ripeness Doctrine:** A doctrine that prevents courts from hearing cases until the issues are sufficiently developed or there is an actual conflict, ensuring that judicial intervention is necessary and appropriate.
- **Treaty Power:** The authority of the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to make treaties with foreign nations. The Constitution is silent on how treaties can be terminated, raising questions about the distribution of this power.

## Questions/Ambiguities

- The dismissal left open significant constitutional questions about the President’s power to terminate treaties and the role of Congress in such decisions. It remains unclear whether the judiciary could review such actions in future cases where there is a direct conflict between the executive and legislative branches.
