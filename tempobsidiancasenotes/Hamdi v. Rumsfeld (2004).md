## Basic Information

Case: Hamdi v. Rumsfeld

Parties:  
- **Plaintiff/Appellant:** Yaser Esam Hamdi  
- **Defendant/Appellee:** Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense

Citation: 542 U.S. 507 (2004)

Court: Supreme Court of the United States

Year: 2004

Judge/Author: Justice Sandra Day O'Connor authored the plurality opinion.

## Laws and Statutes Applied

- **Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) of 2001:** Granted the President broad authority to use military force against individuals or organizations involved in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
- **Article II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution (Commander in Chief Clause):** Provides the President with the authority to direct the military.
- **Fifth Amendment (Due Process Clause):** Guarantees that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, a central issue in the detention of U.S. citizens as enemy combatants.

## Facts of the Case

- Yaser Esam Hamdi, a U.S. citizen born in Louisiana, was captured by U.S. forces in Afghanistan in 2001. He was classified as an "enemy combatant" and detained indefinitely without formal charges or access to an attorney at a military brig in South Carolina.
- Hamdi’s father filed a habeas corpus petition on his behalf, arguing that his son's detention without charges, legal representation, or a trial violated his constitutional rights under the Fifth Amendment.
- The U.S. government argued that Hamdi was captured in an active combat zone and that his detention was justified under the President’s war powers as authorized by the AUMF. The government further claimed that as an enemy combatant, Hamdi was not entitled to traditional due process rights.

## Procedural History

- The District Court granted Hamdi’s habeas petition but was reversed by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled that the courts must defer to the executive’s decision in military matters, including the detention of enemy combatants.
- The case was then appealed to the Supreme Court to determine the extent of the President’s authority to detain U.S. citizens as enemy combatants and the due process rights owed to such detainees.

## Question

1. Does the executive branch have the authority to detain U.S. citizens designated as enemy combatants without providing them with basic due process rights under the Fifth Amendment?

## Arguments

### Plaintiff/Appellant

- Hamdi’s father argued that his son's indefinite detention without charges or access to legal representation violated his constitutional right to due process. He contended that as a U.S. citizen, Hamdi was entitled to the same legal protections guaranteed to all citizens, regardless of his enemy combatant designation.
- The plaintiffs asserted that the government must present evidence justifying Hamdi’s detention before an impartial court and allow him the opportunity to challenge the validity of his classification as an enemy combatant.

### Defendant/Appellee

- The U.S. government argued that Hamdi’s detention was authorized by the AUMF, which gave the President broad powers to detain individuals engaged in hostilities against the United States, even if they were U.S. citizens.
- The government maintained that enemy combatants captured in combat zones could be detained without the protections of civilian courts, and that national security concerns justified Hamdi’s detention without the standard due process afforded in peacetime circumstances.

## Disposition

- The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hamdi, holding that while the government has the authority to detain enemy combatants, U.S. citizens detained as enemy combatants are entitled to basic due process rights, including the right to challenge their detention before a neutral decision-maker.

## Legal Reasoning

- Justice O’Connor’s plurality opinion emphasized the balance between national security concerns and individual liberty. While the Court acknowledged the government’s authority to detain enemy combatants under the AUMF, it held that this authority is not unlimited, particularly when the detainee is a U.S. citizen.
- The Court ruled that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires that U.S. citizens detained as enemy combatants be given notice of the factual basis for their classification and an opportunity to rebut the government’s evidence before a neutral decision-maker.
- The Court rejected the government’s argument that national security concerns allowed for the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens without due process, emphasizing that the Constitution does not permit the executive to have unchecked power, even in times of war.

## Rule of Law

- U.S. citizens designated as enemy combatants by the executive branch are entitled to due process under the Fifth Amendment, including the right to challenge their detention before a neutral decision-maker. The government’s authority to detain individuals in wartime does not override constitutional protections of liberty.

## Concurring Opinion(s)

Author: Justice David Souter (joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg)  
Key Points:  
- Justice Souter concurred in part, arguing that the AUMF did not authorize Hamdi’s detention without due process. He emphasized that the executive branch must follow constitutional procedures when depriving citizens of their liberty, regardless of their designation as enemy combatants.

## Dissenting Opinion(s)

Author: Justice Antonin Scalia (joined by Justice John Paul Stevens)  
Key Points:  
- Justice Scalia dissented, arguing that the government must either charge Hamdi with a crime and try him in civilian courts or seek Congressional suspension of habeas corpus in order to detain him indefinitely. Scalia contended that the Constitution does not permit indefinite detention without trial, even during wartime.

## Key Terms and Definitions

- **Enemy Combatant:** An individual engaged in hostilities against the United States who may be detained by military authorities, though the definition and rights of such detainees have been the subject of significant legal debate.
- **Due Process:** A constitutional guarantee that the government cannot deprive individuals of life, liberty, or property without fair legal procedures and protections.
- **Habeas Corpus:** A legal writ that allows individuals to challenge the legality of their detention before a court.

## Questions/Ambiguities

- The decision leaves open questions about the scope of executive power during wartime and the extent to which the government can detain individuals, particularly foreign nationals, without affording them due process protections.
