## Basic Information

**Case:** Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority (SAMTA)

**Parties:** Joe G. Garcia (Plaintiff) v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority (Defendant)

**Citation:** [469 U.S. 528 (1985)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/469/528/)

**Court:** United States Supreme Court

**Year:** 1985

**Judge/Author:** Justice Harry Blackmun

---

## Laws and Statutes Applied

- **Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938** (29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq.)
- **Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution**
- **Commerce Clause** (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the U.S. Constitution)

---

## Facts of the Case

- The San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority (SAMTA) operated a municipal public transportation system in San Antonio, Texas.
- Joe Garcia, an employee of SAMTA, sued the organization under the **Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)**, seeking overtime pay and other protections.
- SAMTA argued that it was exempt from FLSA requirements under the **Tenth Amendment**, claiming that it was a governmental entity performing traditional governmental functions, which exempted it from federal wage and hour laws.

---

## Procedural History

- The District Court ruled in favor of SAMTA, citing the precedent established in **National League of Cities v. Usery (1976)**, which held that the FLSA could not be applied to state governments engaged in "traditional" governmental functions.
- Garcia appealed the case to the Supreme Court, arguing that the application of FLSA to SAMTA was constitutional under the Commerce Clause.

---

## Question

1. **Does Congress have the authority under the Commerce Clause to apply the Fair Labor Standards Act to a municipally operated public transit system?**
2. **Should the Court overturn the "traditional governmental function" exemption from the Tenth Amendment as set forth in National League of Cities v. Usery?**

---

## Arguments

### Plaintiff/Appellant (Garcia)

- **Commerce Clause Authority:** Garcia argued that SAMTA engaged in interstate commerce through its transit operations and was thus subject to federal regulation under the FLSA.
- **No Tenth Amendment Violation:** Garcia contended that applying the FLSA to SAMTA did not violate the Tenth Amendment because Congress has the authority to regulate labor standards for local entities engaged in activities that affect interstate commerce.

### Defendant/Appellee (SAMTA)

- **Traditional Governmental Function:** SAMTA argued that it was performing a "traditional governmental function" by providing public transportation, and therefore, the FLSA should not apply to it based on the ruling in National League of Cities v. Usery.
- **Tenth Amendment Protection:** SAMTA claimed that the FLSA’s application would violate the Tenth Amendment by infringing on the states' ability to manage their own governmental functions without federal interference.

---

## Disposition

- **5-4 Decision:** The Supreme Court overruled *National League of Cities v. Usery* and held that the FLSA does apply to state and local governments, including SAMTA.

---

## Legal Reasoning

- **Overruling National League of Cities:** The Court rejected the "traditional governmental function" test established in *National League of Cities v. Usery* as unworkable, arguing that it was too difficult to determine which functions were "traditional" and should be exempt from federal regulation.
- **Commerce Clause Power:** The Court reaffirmed that Congress has broad authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate wage and hour standards, including for state and local government employees engaged in activities that affect interstate commerce.
- **State Sovereignty Through Political Process:** The Court reasoned that state sovereignty is protected not by judicially imposed limits but by the political process, where states are adequately represented in Congress. Therefore, applying the FLSA to SAMTA did not violate the Tenth Amendment.

---

## Rule of Law

- **Congress has the authority under the Commerce Clause to apply the Fair Labor Standards Act to state and local government employees, and the "traditional governmental function" exemption from the Tenth Amendment is no longer valid.**

---

## Concurring Opinion(s)

**Author:** Justice Harry Blackmun (Majority Opinion)

**Key Points:**

- Justice Blackmun argued that states' interests are protected by the structure of the federal system and the political process, not by judicial intervention in federalism disputes.

---

## Dissenting Opinion(s)

**Author:** Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. (joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices O'Connor and Burger)

**Key Points:**

- **Erosion of State Sovereignty:** Justice Powell argued that the decision eroded the balance of power between the federal government and the states, diminishing state sovereignty by subjecting local governments to federal wage and hour regulations.
- **Judicial Protection of Federalism:** The dissent emphasized that the judiciary has a role in protecting the states from federal overreach and that the Court's abandonment of the "traditional governmental function" test left states vulnerable to excessive federal control.

---

## Key Terms and Definitions

- **Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA):** A federal law that sets minimum wage, overtime pay, and other labor standards for employees, including public and private sector workers.
- **Commerce Clause:** The constitutional provision giving Congress the power to regulate commerce between the states, used to justify federal regulation of many activities.
- **Tenth Amendment:** Reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states or the people, often invoked in cases involving state sovereignty and federal overreach.

## Questions/Ambiguities

- **Balance of Federalism:** How does this ruling affect the balance between state autonomy and federal regulation in other areas of governance?
- **Federal Labor Standards:** Are there limits to how extensively Congress can regulate state and local governments under the Commerce Clause?

# Addendum (Reasoning): 

The reasoning behind the Supreme Court's decision in **Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority (SAMTA)** (1985) centered on the relationship between **federalism** and Congress’s authority under the **Commerce Clause**, along with the Court's rejection of a previously established test concerning **state sovereignty** under the **Tenth Amendment**. Below is a breakdown of the legal reasoning:

### **Overruling National League of Cities v. Usery**
In **National League of Cities v. Usery (1976)**, the Court held that Congress could not apply federal labor regulations (like the **Fair Labor Standards Act, or FLSA**) to state and local government entities when they were performing **“traditional governmental functions.”** The idea was that forcing states to comply with federal wage and hour standards interfered with state sovereignty under the **Tenth Amendment**.

However, in **Garcia**, the Court decided to **overrule** this precedent. The majority found that the **“traditional governmental function”** test from **Usery** was **unworkable** because it was too difficult to define which government functions were "traditional" or purely state-based. The Court noted that this standard led to inconsistent results and was not a clear, manageable rule for determining when federal law could apply to state and local governments.

**Commerce Clause Power**
The Court emphasized that Congress has **broad authority under the Commerce Clause** to regulate economic activities that affect interstate commerce, including wage and labor standards. The **Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)**, which sets federal standards for wages, hours, and overtime pay, was a valid exercise of this Commerce Clause authority. Since SAMTA was involved in providing public transportation, a service that affects interstate commerce, it was subject to regulation under the FLSA.

###  **State Sovereignty and the Tenth Amendment**
The central question in **Garcia** was whether the **Tenth Amendment** protected SAMTA (a municipal transit authority) from having to comply with the FLSA, a federal law. The Tenth Amendment reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states, and in **Usery**, the Court had used the Tenth Amendment to shield states from certain federal labor laws.

However, in **Garcia**, the Court argued that **state sovereignty is protected not by judicial carve-outs (like the traditional governmental function test), but by the political process** itself. The Court reasoned that state governments are sufficiently protected by their representation in Congress. This **political safeguard of federalism** ensures that state interests are considered in federal legislation, making it unnecessary for the judiciary to intervene with a specific doctrine to protect states from federal regulation.

The majority opinion, written by **Justice Harry Blackmun**, argued that the political process, where states are represented in Congress, was a better mechanism for balancing federal and state power than attempting to draw judicial lines between which functions are “traditional” state functions.

### **Federalism Through the Political Process**
The Court shifted its view on federalism in **Garcia** by stating that the **political process** itself provides adequate protection for states. Because states have representation in Congress, they can advocate for or against federal laws that impact them. The Court thus reasoned that there is no need for a separate judicial doctrine that limits Congress’s ability to impose federal regulations on state governments.

The ruling essentially holds that **state sovereignty is preserved by state participation in the federal legislative process**, rather than by a judicial rule protecting state governments from federal laws that regulate economic activity.

### **Conclusion: The Court’s Reasoning**
- The **“traditional governmental function”** test from *National League of Cities v. Usery* was **unworkable** and led to inconsistent results.
- Congress’s authority under the **Commerce Clause** is broad and allows for regulation of state and local government activities that affect interstate commerce, including labor standards under the FLSA.
- **State sovereignty** is sufficiently protected by the **political process**, where states are represented in Congress. Therefore, judicial intervention to limit Congress’s power (via the Tenth Amendment) was unnecessary.
- The **Tenth Amendment** does not prevent Congress from applying federal wage and hour laws to state and local governments engaged in activities that impact interstate commerce.

### **Rule of Law**
The **Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)** applies to state and local government employees, and the judicially created "traditional governmental function" test from **National League of Cities v. Usery** was overturned. Congress can regulate state and local governments under the **Commerce Clause**, and state sovereignty is protected by the **political process**, not by judicially imposed limits on federal power.
