## Basic Information

Case: Rasul v. Bush

Parties:  
- **Plaintiff/Appellant:** Shafiq Rasul, et al.  
- **Defendant/Appellee:** George W. Bush, President of the United States, et al.

Citation: 542 U.S. 466 (2004)

Court: Supreme Court of the United States

Year: 2004

Judge/Author: Justice John Paul Stevens authored the majority opinion.

## Laws and Statutes Applied

- **28 U.S.C. § 2241 (Habeas Corpus Statute):** Provides federal courts the authority to hear petitions for habeas corpus filed by individuals in custody under U.S. jurisdiction.
- **Alien Enemy Act of 1798:** Allows the detention of foreign nationals during times of war but does not suspend habeas corpus.
- **Article I, Section 9, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution (Suspension Clause):** Prohibits the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus except in cases of rebellion or invasion.

## Facts of the Case

- In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the U.S. government captured and detained several foreign nationals suspected of having ties to terrorism. Shafiq Rasul and other detainees were held at the U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, without charges and without access to U.S. courts.
- The detainees filed petitions for habeas corpus, seeking to challenge the legality of their detention. The U.S. government argued that because the detainees were foreign nationals held outside the sovereign territory of the United States (in Guantanamo Bay), U.S. courts lacked jurisdiction to hear their cases.
- The government claimed that the detainees were "enemy combatants" and therefore not entitled to the protections of U.S. law or international treaties, including the right to challenge their detention through habeas corpus.

## Procedural History

- The District Court dismissed the detainees' habeas petitions, agreeing with the government's argument that U.S. courts had no jurisdiction over foreign nationals detained at Guantanamo Bay.
- The case was appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld the District Court’s decision. The case was then brought to the Supreme Court to decide whether U.S. courts have jurisdiction to hear habeas petitions from foreign nationals held at Guantanamo Bay.

## Question

1. Do U.S. federal courts have jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus petitions filed by foreign nationals detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, who are being held by U.S. authorities?

## Arguments

### Plaintiff/Appellant

- Rasul and the other detainees argued that they were being unlawfully detained without charges and that they had the right to challenge their detention through habeas corpus. They contended that Guantanamo Bay, though technically outside the U.S. mainland, was under the de facto control of the United States, giving U.S. courts jurisdiction to hear their claims.
- The detainees asserted that the denial of access to courts violated fundamental principles of justice and the Suspension Clause of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to habeas corpus unless properly suspended by Congress in times of rebellion or invasion. 

### Defendant/Appellee

- The U.S. government argued that Guantanamo Bay, being located outside the sovereign territory of the United States, was beyond the reach of U.S. courts. The government maintained that foreign nationals detained as enemy combatants at Guantanamo had no right to access U.S. courts or seek habeas relief.
- The government further contended that the military had broad authority during wartime to detain individuals without judicial review and that granting habeas rights to detainees would interfere with national security operations and military discretion. 

## Disposition

- The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Rasul and the other detainees, holding that U.S. federal courts have jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus petitions from foreign nationals detained at Guantanamo Bay.

## Legal Reasoning

- Justice Stevens’ majority opinion emphasized that Guantanamo Bay, though technically outside U.S. borders, is under the complete and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, making it subject to U.S. law. The Court rejected the government’s argument that U.S. courts lacked jurisdiction over the detainees based on their location.
- The Court held that the habeas corpus statute, 28 U.S.C. § 2241, applied to all persons held in custody by U.S. authorities, regardless of their nationality or where they were detained. The ruling concluded that foreign nationals detained at Guantanamo Bay had the right to challenge the legality of their detention in U.S. courts.
- The decision reinforced the principle that the executive branch’s power to detain individuals during wartime is not unchecked, and that judicial oversight is essential to prevent unlawful detention and to protect individual rights, even in the context of national security.

## Rule of Law

- Foreign nationals detained at Guantanamo Bay, a U.S.-controlled military base, have the right to challenge their detention through habeas corpus in U.S. federal courts. The executive branch cannot unilaterally deny habeas rights based on the detainees' location or nationality.

## Concurring Opinion(s)

Author: Justice Anthony Kennedy  
Key Points:  
- Justice Kennedy concurred, emphasizing that Guantanamo Bay is functionally within U.S. control and that denying detainees access to U.S. courts would violate fundamental legal principles. He highlighted the importance of judicial review in ensuring that executive detentions are lawful and not arbitrary.

## Dissenting Opinion(s)

Author: Justice Antonin Scalia (joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Thomas)  
Key Points:  
- Justice Scalia dissented, arguing that extending habeas corpus rights to foreign nationals detained outside U.S. sovereign territory was unprecedented and a misinterpretation of the Constitution. He contended that the majority’s ruling would interfere with the military’s ability to conduct wartime operations and detain enemy combatants effectively.

## Key Terms and Definitions

- **Habeas Corpus:** A legal writ that requires authorities to justify the detention of a person and allows the detained individual to challenge the legality of their detention in court.
- **Enemy Combatant:** A term used to describe individuals detained by the U.S. military during wartime who are alleged to have engaged in hostilities against the United States but are not afforded the same rights as traditional prisoners of war.
- **De Facto Jurisdiction:** The effective control or authority that a government exercises over a territory or area, even if it does not formally have sovereignty over that area.

## Questions/Ambiguities

- The decision raises questions about the scope of habeas corpus rights for foreign nationals detained in U.S. custody in other locations beyond Guantanamo Bay and how future national security cases involving detainees will balance individual rights with military discretion.
