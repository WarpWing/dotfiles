## Facts of the Case

## Question(s)

1. **Does Congress have the authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate employment conditions in intrastate manufacturing of goods destined for interstate commerce?**
2. **Is the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 a constitutional exercise of Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce?**
3. **Does the FLSA infringe upon the powers reserved to the states under the Tenth Amendment?**

## Arguments

### Plaintiff/Appellant (United States)

- **Commerce Clause Authority:** Asserted that the Commerce Clause empowers Congress to regulate labor standards that affect interstate commerce.
- **Substantial Effect:** Argued that substandard labor conditions in intrastate manufacturing have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.
- **Prevent Unfair Competition:** Contended that the FLSA is a legitimate means to prevent unfair competition among states and protect workers' rights.

### Defendant/Appellee (Darby Lumber Company)

- **Local Activity:** Claimed that manufacturing is inherently a local activity and beyond Congress's reach under the Commerce Clause.
- **Tenth Amendment:** Argued that applying the FLSA to intrastate activities infringes upon states' rights reserved by the Tenth Amendment.
- **Exceeds Federal Authority:** Maintained that the FLSA exceeds federal authority and violates constitutional limits on congressional power.

## Disposition

- **Unanimous Decision:** The Supreme Court reversed the District Court's decision, upholding the constitutionality of the FLSA as applied to Darby Lumber Company.

## Legal Reasoning

- **Broad Commerce Power:** The Court held that Congress has the power to regulate intrastate activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.

- **Regulatory Purpose Irrelevant:** Emphasized that the purpose of regulation is irrelevant if the regulated activities substantially affect interstate commerce.
- **Tenth Amendment Interpretation:** Clarified that the Tenth Amendment does not restrict Congress from exercising its enumerated powers, including those under the Commerce Clause.
