## Basic Information

**Case:** National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) v. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)

**Parties:**  
- **Plaintiff/Appellant:** National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB)  
- **Defendant/Appellee:** Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)

**Citation:** 595 U.S. ___ (2022)

**Court:** Supreme Court of the United States

**Year:** 2022

**Judge/Author:** Per Curiam (unsigned opinion)

## Laws and Statutes Applied

- **Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970**  
- **Administrative Procedure Act**  
- **Commerce Clause** of the U.S. Constitution  
- **Nondelegation Doctrine** and its implications on agency power

## Facts of the Case

- **OSHA's COVID-19 Mandate:** OSHA issued an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) that required employers with 100 or more employees to mandate vaccinations or regular testing and masking for unvaccinated workers.
- **Legal Challenge by NFIB:** NFIB and several states challenged the ETS, arguing it was an overreach of OSHA’s statutory authority and that such broad public health measures require Congressional approval.
- **Public Health Argument:** OSHA contended that the ETS was necessary to protect workers from the significant risk posed by COVID-19, particularly in crowded or high-risk work environments.

## Procedural History

- The ETS faced immediate challenges in various federal Circuit Courts, resulting in a temporary stay and conflicting decisions.
- The Supreme Court granted expedited review due to the urgency of the mandate and its widespread implications.

## Question

1. **Did OSHA exceed its statutory authority under the Occupational Safety and Health Act by implementing a broad vaccine-or-test mandate, thereby violating constitutional principles of agency authority and separation of powers?**

## Arguments

### Plaintiff/Appellant

- **Exceeds Statutory Authority:** NFIB argued that OSHA’s authority under the Occupational Safety and Health Act does not extend to broad public health mandates, such as vaccination requirements, which impact individuals beyond the workplace.
- **Separation of Powers Concern:** Imposing such significant economic and social policies is a legislative function, not within the purview of an executive agency without clear Congressional authorization.
- **Nondelegation Principle:** The ETS raised concerns about the nondelegation doctrine, arguing that broad agency powers without explicit limits or guidance from Congress violate the constitutional separation of powers.

### Defendant/Appellee

- **Emergency Powers Justification:** OSHA defended the ETS as a necessary and urgent response to a grave workplace danger, permissible under its statutory emergency powers.
- **Specific to Workplace Safety:** OSHA emphasized that the mandate targeted the workplace environment, which is within its regulatory authority to ensure safety and mitigate risks related to COVID-19 transmission.
- **Protecting Worker Health:** The ETS was argued to be a reasonable exercise of OSHA’s duty to protect workers from serious health threats, including infectious diseases in the workplace.

## Disposition

- The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the NFIB, blocking the ETS from taking effect. The Court found that OSHA had exceeded its statutory authority, highlighting constitutional limits on administrative agencies.

## Legal Reasoning

- **Statutory Overreach:** The Court concluded that OSHA’s ETS exceeded the authority granted under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which did not clearly authorize such broad measures impacting millions of workers.
- **Major Questions Doctrine:** The decision emphasized that significant decisions of economic and political importance require clear Congressional authorization, a principle rooted in maintaining the constitutional separation of powers.
- **Separation of Powers and Agency Limits:** The ruling underscored the constitutional principle that agencies must operate within the constraints set by Congress, and that expansive regulatory measures require explicit legislative backing.

## Rule of Law

- **Limits on Agency Authority:** Federal agencies cannot enact significant regulatory measures impacting broad public health without clear and specific Congressional authorization, particularly when such measures intrude on personal liberties.

## Concurring Opinion(s)

**Author:** Justice Gorsuch  
**Key Points:**  
- Stressed the importance of maintaining a clear separation between legislative and executive functions, reinforcing that agencies cannot assume powers not explicitly granted by Congress.
- Warned against the dangers of broad administrative overreach, which undermines democratic accountability.

## Dissenting Opinion(s)

**Author:** Justice Breyer, joined by Justices Sotomayor and Kagan  
**Key Points:**  
- Argued that OSHA acted within its mandate to protect worker safety in light of a significant health crisis, and that the ETS was a permissible exercise of its emergency powers.
- Criticized the majority for undermining OSHA’s ability to respond to emergent workplace health threats, setting a restrictive precedent on agency authority.

## Key Terms and Definitions

- **Major Questions Doctrine:** A principle that courts should require clear congressional authorization for decisions of vast economic and political significance by administrative agencies.
- **Nondelegation Doctrine:** The constitutional principle that Congress cannot delegate its legislative powers to executive agencies without clear guidelines or limits.

## Questions/Ambiguities

- **Future Implications for Agency Actions:** How will this decision affect the scope of regulatory actions by agencies in future public health crises?
- **Congressional Response:** Will Congress act to clarify the boundaries of OSHA’s authority, particularly in health emergencies?

## Related Cases

- **Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. (1984):** Established deference to agency interpretations of statutes, but raised questions when broad regulatory power is asserted.
- **Industrial Union Dept., AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Institute (1980):** Discussed the limits of OSHA’s regulatory authority under the nondelegation doctrine.
