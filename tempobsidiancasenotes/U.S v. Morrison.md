## Basic Information

Case: United States v. Morrison

Parties:  
- **Plaintiff/Appellant:** United States of America  
- **Defendant/Appellee:** Antonio Morrison, et al.

Citation: 529 U.S. 598 (2000)

Court: Supreme Court of the United States

Year: 2000

Judge/Author: Chief Justice William Rehnquist authored the majority opinion.

## Laws and Statutes Applied

- **Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 1994:** A federal law that provided a civil remedy for victims of gender-motivated violence, allowing them to sue their attackers in federal court.
- **Commerce Clause:** Grants Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states, which was invoked as the constitutional basis for VAWA’s civil remedy provision.
- **14th Amendment, Section 5:** Empowers Congress to enforce the guarantees of equal protection and due process, which was also cited as a justification for VAWA’s provisions.

## Facts of the Case

- Christy Brzonkala, a student at Virginia Tech, filed a lawsuit against Antonio Morrison and James Crawford under the Violence Against Women Act, alleging that the two men raped her. The university disciplinary proceedings initially found Morrison guilty but later reversed the decision on appeal.
- Brzonkala filed suit in federal court under VAWA’s civil remedy provision, which allowed victims of gender-based violence to seek damages from their assailants in federal court, arguing that the assault was motivated by gender and violated her rights under VAWA.
- Morrison and Crawford challenged the constitutionality of VAWA, arguing that Congress lacked the authority under the Commerce Clause and the 14th Amendment to enact the law’s civil remedy provision, claiming that it intruded upon state jurisdiction over criminal law.

## Procedural History

- The District Court ruled that Congress exceeded its authority under the Commerce Clause and the 14th Amendment when enacting the civil remedy provision of VAWA, striking down the statute. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court’s decision, and the case was appealed to the Supreme Court.

## Question

1. Does Congress have the authority under the Commerce Clause or the 14th Amendment to enact the civil remedy provision of the Violence Against Women Act, which allows victims of gender-motivated violence to sue their attackers in federal court?

## Arguments

### Plaintiff/Appellant

- The United States argued that VAWA’s civil remedy provision was a valid exercise of Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause because gender-based violence substantially affects interstate commerce by deterring women from traveling, working, and engaging in commercial activities.
- The government also contended that the 14th Amendment provided a constitutional basis for VAWA, as it was intended to redress systemic failures by states to adequately protect women from gender-based violence and ensure equal protection of the laws.
- The United States pointed to extensive congressional findings demonstrating the national economic impact of gender-motivated violence, arguing that such violence had a significant effect on interstate commerce, justifying federal intervention.

### Defendant/Appellee

- Morrison and Crawford argued that the civil remedy provision of VAWA exceeded Congress’s enumerated powers under the Commerce Clause, as the statute attempted to regulate non-economic, criminal conduct that traditionally fell within the domain of state authority.
- The defendants contended that gender-based violence did not have a direct effect on interstate commerce sufficient to warrant federal regulation, and that allowing such regulation would effectively eliminate the distinction between federal and state powers.
- They also argued that the 14th Amendment could not support VAWA’s civil remedy provision because the amendment prohibits only state action, not private conduct, and Congress lacked the authority to regulate purely private acts of violence.

## Disposition

- The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Morrison, striking down the civil remedy provision of the Violence Against Women Act as unconstitutional. The Court held that Congress had exceeded its authority under both the Commerce Clause and the 14th Amendment.

## Legal Reasoning

- Chief Justice Rehnquist’s opinion emphasized that Congress’s authority under the Commerce Clause extends only to activities that are economic in nature and have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. The Court held that gender-motivated violence was a non-economic activity that did not meet this threshold, and thus could not be regulated by Congress under the Commerce Clause.
- The decision also reinforced the principle that the 14th Amendment applies only to state actions, not private conduct. The Court found that VAWA’s civil remedy provision improperly sought to regulate private behavior without sufficient connection to state discrimination or denial of equal protection.
- The ruling underscored the importance of maintaining the constitutional balance of power between federal and state governments, emphasizing that criminal law enforcement and remedies for victims of crime are primarily state responsibilities.

## Rule of Law

- Congress cannot regulate non-economic, intrastate activities like gender-motivated violence under the Commerce Clause, nor can it impose federal civil remedies on private actors under the 14th Amendment when such actions are traditionally governed by state law. The decision reaffirms the limits of federal authority and preserves the distinction between state and federal regulatory powers.

## Concurring Opinion(s)

Author: Justice Clarence Thomas  
Key Points:  
- Justice Thomas concurred with the majority, arguing that the Court should adopt an even more restrictive view of the Commerce Clause, asserting that the Clause was intended only to regulate commerce in its strict sense and should not be used to justify expansive federal regulation of non-commercial activities.

## Dissenting Opinion(s)

Author: Justice David Souter  
Key Points:  
- Justice Souter dissented, arguing that Congress had adequately demonstrated the substantial effects of gender-motivated violence on interstate commerce through extensive findings, and that the Court should defer to Congress’s judgment on such matters. Souter contended that the majority’s approach unduly restricted Congress’s power to address nationwide problems affecting the economy.

## Key Terms and Definitions

- **Commerce Clause:** A constitutional provision granting Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states, used by Congress to justify various forms of federal regulation but limited by judicial interpretations in non-economic contexts.
- **14th Amendment, Section 5:** Grants Congress the authority to enforce the protections of the 14th Amendment against state infringements but does not extend to regulating private conduct absent state involvement.

## Questions/Ambiguities

- The decision raises questions about the scope of Congress’s power to address widespread social issues that have indirect economic impacts, and the appropriate balance between state and federal authority in areas traditionally regulated by states.

## Related Cases

- **United States v. Lopez (1995):** Struck down a federal law criminalizing gun possession in school zones, marking a significant limitation on Congress’s use of the Commerce Clause to regulate non-economic activity, laying the groundwork for Morrison.
- **Gonzales v. Raich (2005):** Upheld federal regulation of homegrown marijuana as part of the broader regulatory scheme under the Commerce Clause, contrasting with Morrison’s limitation on non-economic regulatory authority.
- **Katzenbach v. McClung (1964):** Upheld the use of the Commerce Clause to combat racial discrimination in restaurants, highlighting a broader interpretation of federal power when dealing with economic impacts, in contrast to Morrison’s narrower view.
