## Basic Information

Case: Gibbons v. Ogden  
Parties: Thomas Gibbons (Plaintiff) vs. Aaron Ogden (Defendant)  
Citation: [22 U.S. 1 (1824) ](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/gibbons-v-ogden) 
Court: Marshall Court  
Year: 1824  
Judge/Author: Chief Justice John Marshall  

## Laws Applied

- Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, U.S. Constitution)  
- Supremacy Clause (Article VI, U.S. Constitution)  

## Facts of the Case

- Aaron Ogden held an exclusive steamboat operation license granted by the State of New York for the navigation of waters between New York and New Jersey.  
- Thomas Gibbons operated steamboats under a federal coastal license that conflicted with Ogden's state-granted monopoly.  
- Ogden filed suit in New York state courts to prevent Gibbons from operating in these waters, claiming his exclusive rights under the New York law. Gibbons argued that his federal license superseded Ogden's state-granted monopoly under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

## Procedural History

- The New York state courts sided with Ogden, granting him an injunction against Gibbons' steamboat operations.
- Gibbons appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that the federal government had the exclusive right to regulate interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause.

## Question 

1. Does the Commerce Clause give Congress the authority to regulate interstate navigation, thus overriding conflicting state laws?

## Arguments

### Plaintiff/Appellant (Thomas Gibbons)

- Gibbons argued that the federal government has the exclusive power to regulate interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution.
- He contended that his federal license, issued under a 1793 law regulating coastal trade, gave him the right to operate in interstate waters.
- Gibbons also invoked the Supremacy Clause, arguing that federal law preempts any state law that conflicts with it, rendering Ogden's monopoly invalid.

### Defendant/Appellee (Aaron Ogden)

- Ogden argued that the power to regulate navigation within state boundaries remained with the states, not the federal government.
- He contended that his exclusive rights granted by New York law were valid because navigation was a local matter, not subject to federal regulation under the Commerce Clause.
- Ogden also argued that Congress had not explicitly included steamboat navigation as part of its power to regulate commerce, making New York's law supreme in this case.

## Disposition

- The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Gibbons, holding that the federal government, under the Commerce Clause, has the power to regulate interstate navigation, and thus Gibbons' federal license overrode Ogden's state-granted monopoly.

## Legal Reasoning

- Chief Justice Marshall held that the Commerce Clause grants Congress the power to regulate not only the exchange of goods but also navigation as part of interstate commerce.  
- The Court rejected the argument that states retain authority over navigation within their borders when it involves interstate commerce, asserting that federal law takes precedence under the Supremacy Clause.  
- Marshall emphasized that the purpose of the Commerce Clause was to create a unified national economy, free from conflicting state laws that could hinder interstate trade and navigation.

## Rule of Law

- The Commerce Clause gives Congress the authority to regulate interstate commerce, including navigation, and federal law preempts conflicting state laws under the Supremacy Clause.

## Key Terms and Definitions

- **Commerce Clause**: Grants Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, among the states, and with Native American tribes (Article I, Section 8, U.S. Constitution).
- **Supremacy Clause**: Establishes that the U.S. Constitution, and federal laws made pursuant to it, are the supreme law of the land (Article VI, U.S. Constitution).

## Questions/Ambiguities

- How broadly should the term "commerce" be interpreted under the Commerce Clause?  
- To what extent can states regulate local matters that indirectly affect interstate commerce?

## Related Cases  

- **McCulloch v. Maryland (1819)**: Affirmed the supremacy of federal laws over state laws and reinforced the federal governmentâ€™s authority under the Constitution.  
- **Wickard v. Filburn (1942)**: Further expanded the interpretation of the Commerce Clause to include even local activities that could impact interstate commerce.  
- **United States v. Lopez (1995)**: Limited the scope of the Commerce Clause, holding that not all activities affecting interstate commerce fall under federal regulation.
