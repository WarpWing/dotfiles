## Basic Information

Case: Marbury v. Madison
Parties: William Marbury (plaintiff) v. James Madison (defendant)
Citation: 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803)
Court: United States Supreme Court
Year: 1803
Judge/Author: Chief Justice John Marshall

## Facts of the Case

- President John Adams appointed William Marbury as Justice of the Peace in final days of presidency
- New Secretary of State James Madison refused to deliver Marbury's commission
- Marbury petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of mandamus to force Madison to deliver the commission

## Procedural History

- Marbury filed a petition directly with the Supreme Court
- No lower court decisions, as this was filed under the Court's original jurisdiction

## Legal Issues

1. Does Marbury have a right to the commission?
2. If he has a right, and that right has been violated, do the laws afford him a remedy?
3. If they do afford him a remedy, is it a mandamus from this court?

## Arguments

### Plaintiff (Marbury)

- Appointment was valid when signed and sealed
- Entitled to remedy for violation of vested legal right
- Supreme Court has power to issue writ of mandamus

### Defendant (Madison)

- (Note: Madison did not actually appear or present arguments)

## Holding

- Marbury had a right to his commission
- The law provides a remedy for violation of this right
- Supreme Court cannot issue the writ because Section 13 of Judiciary Act is unconstitutional

## Legal Reasoning

- Commissions are complete upon signing and sealing
- Government of laws, not of men, requires remedies for rights violations
- Constitution is supreme law, courts must uphold it over conflicting statutes
- Judiciary's role is to interpret the law, including determining constitutionality

## Rule of Law

- The Supreme Court has the power of judicial review to declare laws unconstitutional

## Disposition

- Petition denied; Court lacks jurisdiction to issue writ

## Concurring Opinion(s)

- None (unanimous decision)

## Dissenting Opinion(s)

- None (unanimous decision)

## Key Terms and Definitions

- [[../../../../../definitions/Judicial Review|Judicial Review]]: Power of courts to review and potentially invalidate laws and government actions that violate the Constitution
- [[../../../../../definitions/Writ of Mandamus|Writ of Mandamus]] : Court order to a government official to properly fulfill their official duties 

## Questions/Ambiguities

- Was Marshall's reasoning circular in establishing judicial review?
- Should Marshall have recused himself due to prior involvement as Secretary of State?

## Potential Applications/Hypotheticals

- How might this decision apply to future cases involving executive actions?
- Could this principle extend to state courts reviewing state laws?

## Personal Notes/Reflections

- Landmark case establishing judicial review
- Brilliant political move by Marshall to assert power while avoiding direct conflict with Jefferson administration


## Decision

The Court found that Madison’s refusal to deliver the commission was illegal, but did not order Madison to hand over Marbury’s commission via writ of mandamus. Instead, the Court held that the provision of the Judiciary Act of 1789 enabling Marbury to bring his claim to the Supreme Court was itself unconstitutional, since it purported to extend the Court’s original jurisdiction beyond that which Article III, Section 2, established. 

Marshall expanded that a writ of mandamus was the proper way to seek a remedy, but concluded the Court could not issue it. Marshall reasoned that the Judiciary Act of 1789 conflicted with the Constitution. Congress did not have power to modify the Constitution through regular legislation because Supremacy Clause places the Constitution before the laws. 

In so holding, Marshall established the principle of judicial review, i.e., the power to declare a law unconstitutional.
