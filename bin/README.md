## This is where I store all of my binaries (which link to their respective repositories and will be cloned recursively). These will all get correct chmod permissions and move to /usr/local/bin

## List of binaries
[cafmenu](https://github.com/WarpWing/Pitchfork/blob/main/bin/cafmenu) - A bin version of my Python bot that webscrapes the Dickinson Cafeteria menu for the daily menu and emails people via SMTP on a cronjob basis.


[dickdir](https://github.com/WarpWing/WatchDog/blob/main/bin/dickdir) - A bin version of my "WatchDog" OSINT tool which searches the Dickinson Campus Directory, allows me to search by name, email and department. Returns name, status (student,faculty,staff), as well as (if applicable: title,courses,building,phone number,education,department).
